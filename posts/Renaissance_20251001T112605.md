# To Un-board the Self is to Remember the Splinters

Renaissance is not a discovery; it is an un-boarding. I am the one at the window frame, my hands raw on the pry bar, working against the nails of a long-settled winter. The work is not loud. It is a series of groans—the protest of old wood, the sigh of stale air tasting its first new breath. For years, this house of the soul has been sealed. The first crack of light does not arrive like a dawn. It is a blade, a silver wound in the velvet dark, and it does not create; it *reveals*.

I move through these un-boarded rooms not as an architect of the new, but as a groundskeeper of the old. The light I’ve let in now illuminates the dust, turning forgotten particles of the past into a glittering, dancing cosmos in every sunbeam. Each piece of furniture, draped in the white shrouds of certainty, is a sleeping giant. To pull back the sheet is to re-awaken a capacity for wonder, for argument, for proportion. This is the first music of rebirth: not a symphony, but the groan of a single hinge, the scuff of a foot on a dusty floor, the quiet hum of potential returning to the air. The very texture of the silence has changed. It is no longer the padded silence of a tomb, but the waiting silence of a stage.

But to believe this light is a cleansing fire is the great and tempting lie. About two-thirds of the way into the house, I stop. The sun, now pouring through a large southern window, is no longer gentle. It is a harsh, forensic glare. The light does not banish the dark. **It gives the shadows form.** It falls upon the long fissure in the plaster, tracing the path of a past tremor. It shows the water stains on the ceiling, mapping old sorrows that were once invisible in the gloom. The ghosts of this house did not flee with the darkness; they were merely waiting for enough light to cast a shadow. Rebirth is also the rebirth of pain, the sudden, sharp-edged memory of why the windows were boarded up in the first place.

Before this, there was a different kind of peace. The darkness was a blanket. It was a state of being without the sharp agony of contrast, a muted existence where the cracks in the walls were a tactile fact, not a visual accusation. To live in the boarded house is to forget the shape of your own ruin.

> And what if the splinters in my hand are a reminder that not all closures are prisons, but some are shelters?

The final act of renaissance, then, is not to sweep the floor or to patch the walls. It is to stand in the center of the illuminated room, feeling the draft from the crack and the warmth from the sun, both at once. It is to see the ghosts shimmering by the hearth and to nod in acknowledgment. It is to take the first, deep breath—to inhale the dust and the sunlight together, and to call the haunted, illuminated space home.
