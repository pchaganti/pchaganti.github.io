# The Architecture of the Unstable I

I am the architect of a tower with no blueprint. Its stones are hewn from the quarry of a single day’s thoughts, its mortar a thin paste of doubt and memory. I do not build upwards toward God or a final truth, but inwards, in a slow, winding spiral. My only tools are the question and the wondering glance. I am the sole inhabitant of this structure called Michel, and its masonry is my own flesh, my own fleeting mind.

The ascent is a textured thing. My hand runs along the cool, rough-hewn wall of a past judgment, feeling its surprising porousness. Each step groans with the weight of a new observation, a contradiction that settles unevenly upon the last. This is not a fortress of belief. It is an essay in stone, a constant *trying*. There are windows, yes, but they are not for gazing out at the world to conquer it with reason. They exist only to cast a different light on the interior walls, to see how a shadow falls across a familiar prejudice, how the afternoon sun exposes the dust of vanity on a ledge I had thought was clean. The only sound is the echo of my own footfalls, the quiet scratching of a pen, and the endless, whispering question:

> Que sais-je?

What do I know? The question is not the foundation; it is the perpetual, unsettling draft that keeps the air from growing stale. It prevents the mortar from ever truly setting. To live here is to accept the magnificent vertigo of contingency, to understand that the self is not a monument to be completed, but a residence in a constant state of repair and reconsideration.

But lately, I have felt the shadow of another structure on the horizon. It is not a tower, but a fortress—perfectly square, seamless, and silent. It is the architecture of certainty, built by those who believe the self is a quarry with a finite supply of stone, a project with a final, achievable form. That fortress is what I am not. Its walls are thick with dogma, defending a small, stagnant courtyard of truth. It has no windows, only arrow-slits. It is a tomb built for a living idea, and its silence is the silence of a conclusion. To stand in its shadow is to feel the cold of an answer that has murdered all other questions.

Seeing it, I understand the nature of my own work more clearly. This tower, my own shambling, spiraling self, is not a failure of design. Its instability is its very character. I climb again, not to escape the world, but to inhabit my own. I reach the highest, most precarious stone I have yet laid and look down, not at the ground far below, but at the winding, irregular path I have traveled to get here. The wind rushes through the gaps between the ill-fitting stones, and for a moment, the whole structure seems to sing with a perilous life. The wind is not a flaw in the design. **It is the design.**
