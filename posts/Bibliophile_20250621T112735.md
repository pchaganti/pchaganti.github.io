# To Read is to Haunt

I am not a collector of objects, but a haunter of lives. To be a bibliophile is to be a ghost, to choose a state of being that exists in the whisper-thin space between one cover and another. My library is not a room of furniture and paper, but a silent, crowded city of souls where I am the resident phantom. The air here is cool, thick with the scent of dried ink and brittle glue—the dust of countless forgotten worlds. To open a book is not an act of leisure; it is to slip through a keyhole, to shed my own skin and wear the consciousness of another, walking their corridors and feeling the phantom echo of their heartbreaks.

This haunting is a deliberate surrender. With each page turned, my own pulse quiets, my own thoughts recede, replaced by the thrum of a narrative that is not mine. The rustle of a page is a footstep in a mind I now inhabit. The weight of a tome in my hands is the gravity of a life, its binding the architecture of its memories. I trace the words not to learn, but to *become*. For a few precious hours, I am a sea captain charting impossible courses, a lover penning desperate letters in a time of war, a philosopher staring into the abyss from an Athenian porch. I am everyone but myself. **My own story is the ink I use to read others.** This is not escape; it is a profound and willing dissolution.

But the ghost who glides through every wall eventually forgets the feeling of a closed door. The haunting is a one-way passage. I can witness the grandest passions and the most devastating sorrows, feel their spectral chill or warmth pass through me, but I can never change the story. I am a perpetual observer, a vessel for echoes. I am forever pressing my incorporeal form against a windowpane, watching a life unfold with an intimacy no living soul could possess, yet utterly powerless to touch, to speak, to *be*. The silence of my library, once a comfort, begins to feel like a judgment.

> Does the spirit who haunts a thousand rooms forget the shape of its own?

Herein lies the shadow of the bibliophile. It is not the unread book, but the *unwritten* life. The terror is not in the stories that end, but in the one that never fully begins. For every world I inhabit, a piece of my own is left fallow, un-tilled. The love of these myriad lives becomes the very thing that consumes the one I was given. **This is the ghost’s bargain:** to gain access to all stories at the cost of your own narrative fading, becoming faint, a palimpsest scrubbed clean to make room for another's text.

And so I stand amidst the shelves, a silent specter in my own museum. I reach for another volume, its cover dark and glossy. For a moment, I see a face reflected on its surface—pale, indistinct, barely there. It is a question shimmering in the dim light: a ghost, or a reader about to become one? The distinction has long since blurred. I open the cover, and the reflection vanishes.
