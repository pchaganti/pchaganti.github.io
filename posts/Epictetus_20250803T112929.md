# To Grind the Soul's Glass

I am a grinder of lenses, and my workshop is the soul. The world arrives as a storm of raw light—blinding, fractured, a cacophony of brilliance and shadow that promises paradise and threatens annihilation in the same searing flash. It is the urgent glare of desire, the cold refraction of loss, the unsteady flicker of another’s opinion. Most live their lives squinting, their vision scarred and warped by this onslaught, mistaking every mirage for an oasis and every shadow for a monster. They believe their task is to tame the light. They are mistaken.

My work is not to command the sun, nor to still the chaotic dance of photons. Such things are not mine to control. My work is with the glass. This fragile, flawed disc of perception, handed to me at birth, is the only thing that is truly mine. It arrived clouded with instinct, pocked with impressions. So I sit at my bench. I take up the abrasive grit of reason and the patient, circular pressure of discipline. I grind. **This is the work.** Each day, I hold the glass to the storm and observe the distortions. That flash of anger—is it the light itself, or a flaw in my glass? That wave of despair—is it the world’s true nature, or a deep scratch in my own perception?

> What is mine, and what is merely a reflection upon my glass?

The goal is clarity. To grind and polish the soul until it becomes a lens so true that it can distinguish the light itself from the phantoms it casts upon the interior surface. To see a beautiful object without the distortion of covetousness. To feel an insult without the crack of injury. To face the final, fading light without the dark smear of fear. The world does what it does. The lens simply observes, unshaken and clear. It does not add, it does not subtract. It sees, and in seeing clearly, it grants freedom.

But a whisper of heresy haunts the workshop. In the pursuit of a flawless surface, does one grind away the very capacity for warmth? A perfect lens is cold. It transmits light but is not changed by it. By polishing away the distortions of grief, do we also wear away the texture of love? By seeking a state untouched by the world’s chaos, do we create a stillness that is indistinguishable from death? What is a man who feels no sting from the jagged shards of light we call loss? He may be free, but is he still human? The shadow of this craft is a terrible perfection—a clear, crystalline void.

The heresy fades. I have misunderstood the craft. The goal is not the destination of the pristine lens, but the dignity of the grinding itself. The virtue is not in a final, passionless clarity, but in the unwavering commitment to the bench, day after day. It is the sacred motion of polishing, the refusal to surrender the glass to the storm. It is an act of devotion to the one thing I can control: my own reasoned choice to see truly.

The light still rages. The storm of the world is not, and never will be, tamed. But I hold the glass to my eye—not to erase the storm, but to see it for what it is. The world remains unbroken in its chaos, and I, in my attention, remain whole.
