# The Bell Whose True Sound Is Silence

Do not mistake the haiku for a poem. I am a caster of bells, and I tell you this: a haiku is not the bronze, nor the inscription, nor the beautiful shape of the vessel. It is the strike, and more than the strike, the resonance that hollows out the air a moment later. It is a tool for forging silence. **A haiku is a bell.**

I cast them not from words, but from moments. From the cold weight of a single raindrop clinging to a pine needle. From the brief, shared glance with a fox at dusk. The process is a violent one, requiring immense pressure to collapse a universe of feeling into seventeen sounds, just as one must smelt and hammer metal into a perfect, resonant form. The first line lifts the mallet. The second is the sharp, percussive *gong* of contact—the image, the action. The third is not an end, but the beginning of the great hum, the vibration that rushes outward, pushing the noise of the world away to make a space. The words are merely the catalyst for this sudden, profound quiet. *The meaning is what happens in you after the sound dies.*

We live our lives in a foundry of constant, meaningless noise. The clatter of obligation, the hiss of anxiety, the grinding of thoughts that lead nowhere. This is the unshaped world, the raw ore of experience. A haiku is an act of deliberate, focused alchemy. It does not add more noise. It introduces a single, perfect tone, a vibration so pure that it causes all the other, lesser frequencies to fall away. For an instant, the world holds its breath. The poem is not *on* the page; it is in the stillness the page creates inside the reader. It is the sudden awareness of the room you are in, the light from the window, the texture of your own breathing.

But what of the bell that is never struck? This is the shadow of haiku. It is the torrent of moments we allow to rush past, unobserved and un-rung. It is the landscape seen only from a speeding train, a blur of green and brown without distinction. It is a life lived as a constant, dull roar—a cacophony of metal shards that have never known the clarifying fire of the forge or the singular purpose of the mallet. The opposite of the haiku is not the epic poem; it is the distracted mind. It is the endless scroll, the chatter that fills every void.

> What does it mean to build a bell that you intend to strike only once, knowing its truest purpose is the silence that follows?

This is the turn. The bell-caster's secret is that the goal is not to create a more beautiful sound, but to teach the ear to cherish the absence of sound. The haiku-bell is not a monument to the moment, but an instrument that recalibrates our perception. After its resonance fades, the ordinary silence of the world feels different. It is no longer empty; it is charged, awake, and listening. **The haiku returns you to the world, but with your senses sharpened to its quiet truths.**

And so the bell hangs, cool and still again. The sound is gone completely. The words have evaporated from the mind. All that remains is the air in the temple, trembling with an unheard memory. A space has been cleared. And in that space, you can finally hear the sound of a single leaf falling.
