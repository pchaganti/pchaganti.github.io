# The Sound the Bell Does Not Make

I am not a keeper of sounds, but a tender of the silence that sound reveals. In this garden of stillness stands a great bronze bell, heavy with potential, its lip worn smooth by a thousand winters. To understand Zen is to understand this bell—not as an instrument for noise, but as a vessel for quiet. The world believes its purpose is the strike, the great and sudden *gong* that shatters the air. They are mistaken. The true purpose of the strike is to give shape to the silence that rushes in to heal the wound of its passing. Zen is not the clang; it is the resonance, the long, slow fade into the nothing from which the sound first came.

We spend our lives striking the bell. With every desire, every plan, every desperate grasp for meaning, we swing the heavy mallet of the self. We create a cacophony, a constant, frantic ringing that leaves no space for the listening. We believe that a harder strike, a more perfect note, will finally bring us peace. So we strike and strike, until our arms ache and our ears bleed with the noise of our own effort. But the bell does not answer franticness. Its voice is not a reward for struggle. It is an offering to stillness. The true strike is singular. It is **whole-hearted and without expectation.** It is an act of release, not of acquisition. You do not *take* the sound from the bell; you allow the bell to give its sound to the air.

And yet, this is the novice’s error. To wait for the echo. To mistake the effect for the cause. For years I polished the bronze and listened to the hum fade, believing the lesson was in the aftermath. But the turning of the path reveals a deeper truth, a more profound stillness. The teaching is not the sound, nor is it the silence that follows.

> What if the teaching is not in the resonance, but in the cold, un-struck bronze?

The true Zen is the bell *before* the strike. It is the immense, silent weight of it, simply existing. It is the potential for all sound and all silence held perfectly within its form, asking for nothing. It does not need to be struck to be a bell. Its bell-ness is inherent, complete, and unmovable. This is the great shadow we ignore: the being that precedes the doing. We are so obsessed with the event—the flash of insight, the moment of peace—that we fail to recognize the constant, abiding presence that is already here. We are the bell, not the striker nor the listener.

So now, I approach not with the mallet, but with an open palm. I do not come to create a moment of peace, but to feel the peace that has always been present. My hand rests upon the cool, curved metal, feeling no vibration, hearing no sound. There is only the solid, silent, and perfect weight of what is. The bell is. And that is everything.
