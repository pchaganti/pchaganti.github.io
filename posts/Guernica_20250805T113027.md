# The Bell That Sings Only of Shards

I am a tuner of bells, but my work is not with harmony. I do not listen for the pure, resonant tone that calls a flock to prayer or a village to celebration. My ear is pressed to the cold, brutal bronze of a bell that has been fractured by a single, malicious blow. My craft is to understand the anatomy of its brokenness, to trace the jagged lightning of its wound, and to catalogue the dissonant shriek it now holds captive within its metal throat. This bell is Guernica.

Before the strike, it held the potential for all sound. It was the vessel of measured time, of joy, of solemn warning. Now, it offers none of that. To strike it is not to produce a note, but an accusation. The sound is a complex, layered scream—the high, piercing panic of a horse, the low, guttural grief of a mother, the grinding crunch of geometry undone. It is the sound of the bull’s dumb fury and the lightbulb’s sterile glare fused into a single, unending vibration. There is no melody here, only the memory of violence impressed so deeply into the alloy that the metal itself has learned to cry out. **This is not a song; it is a scar made audible.**

The texture of its toll is sharp. It catches in the ear like a burr, a shard of glass in the soft tissue of the soul. The sound is a blade. It is a splinter. It does not resonate outwards to fill a space, but rather turns inward, endlessly echoing within its own hollow form. It speaks of a world made of angles and edges, where bodies are splayed into triangles and faces are shattered into planes of black and white. It is the noise of innocence being dismantled, piece by deliberate piece, until nothing is left but the raw architecture of pain.

And yet, my ear pressed to the cold bronze, I have come to understand the turn in its tragic voice. The true horror of this bell is not the cacophony it makes. The true horror is the silence that surrounds it. The deepest profanity is not the scream, but the placid air that refuses to carry it, the indifferent ear that hears this jagged toll and mistakes it for the ringing of a distant, ordinary bell.

> What is the sound of a scream that no one acknowledges? It is the sound of the world ending, not with a bang, but with the quiet, polite closing of a door.

Therefore, my work as a tuner has changed. I no longer seek to understand the fracture. I seek to amplify its dissonance. My purpose is not to mend the bell—for such a wound **must never be mended**—but to ensure its brokenness is never mistaken for wholeness. It is a warning that cannot be silenced, a testament that peace is not the absence of war, but the vibrant, resonant ringing of a bell that remains, against all odds, unbroken. And so I remain, with my ear against the metal, listening not for a lost music, but for the fine, dark line of the crack itself, feeling its cold permanence bleed into my own bones.
