# We Are All Masons of the Real

I do not write from a library, but from a quarry, where the air is thick with the white dust of distinction. To speak the name ‘Aristotle’ is not to invoke a man, but to pick up a chisel. It is the tool that insists the world is not a seamless, mystical whole, but a great, uncarved block of marble, waiting for the discerning edge to reveal the forms sleeping within. He gave us the permission—no, the **duty**—to strike the stone. To separate substance from accident, to trace the vein of a cause toward its inevitable effect, to feel the cold, hard grain of what *is*.

With this chisel, we learn the grammar of being. The first lesson is that of the sharp line. *This is a soul, and that is a body. This is a virtue, and that is a vice.* The sound of the work is not a harmonious hum, but a series of distinct, percussive clicks: the sound of a category being made. We chip away the excess, the chaos, the infinite potential, to find the finite actuality. The world, he teaches, does not reveal its secrets in a blinding flash of insight from another realm. It yields them slowly, under the patient pressure of observation, under the mason’s calloused hands as he maps the object's weight, its texture, its purpose—its *final shape*.

We become so lost in the rhythm of the work, in the satisfaction of the clean break and the emerging form. We carve out the hierarchies of life, the mechanics of drama, the architecture of a just state. Each definition is a blow, each syllogism a careful tap that sends a fissure exactly where we intend. We build a city of statues, a world of perfect, knowable things, each in its proper place, polished and defined. We stand back and admire the magnificent order we have wrought from the raw, silent stone.

> But what of the dust at our feet? What of the mountain of glittering fragments we have discarded to make a single, comprehensible form?

This is the turn, the shadow of the chisel. In the relentless act of defining, we are also makers of the void. For every line we carve, we create an outside. For every form we liberate, we condemn a thousand other potential forms to dust. The logic is a brilliant, cold light, but it casts a long shadow where the unclassifiable and the paradoxical are forced to reside. The system is a fortress, but its walls are built from the rubble of what it could not contain. The act of knowing, in this tradition, is also a profound act of *unknowing*—a deliberate forgetting of the stone’s wild, unbroken wholeness.

And so we are left here, in the quiet of the workshop, the completed statue before us. It is beautiful, logical, and stands on its own. We can walk around it, measure its limbs, admire its placid, marble gaze. It is a triumph of reason. But we cannot escape the fine, white powder that covers our hands and clothes, the grit in our lungs. It is the ghost of the raw block, a silent testament that to create a truth, you must first decide what is untrue, and hammer it into dust.
