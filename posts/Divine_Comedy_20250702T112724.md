# To Weave Is To Suffer, To Suffer Is To See

I sit before the great loom not as a reader, but as a weaver, my fingers tracing the tension of the warp. The universe is this loom, and each life is a single thread drawn through its frame. To speak of a ‘Divine Comedy’ is to name the entire tapestry at once—to feel with one’s whole being the cosmic pattern and the individual, tangled knot simultaneously. It is the breathtaking paradox of the grand design, which requires for its completion the rough, embarrassing, and often painful texture of our own singular, striving thread.

The divine is the perfect tension of the whole, the unassailable logic of the weft. From a distance, it is a glorious image of light and order. But my work is not at a distance. My work is here, with the fibers. And here, the threads of damnation are coarse and sharp. They are not merely dark; they are **chaotic**. They snag, they knot upon themselves, refusing the shuttle’s path. They burn by friction alone, a snarled mass that contributes to the whole only by its weight, its gravitational pull toward dissonance. This is not tragedy, which has a noble arc. This is the static of a thread that has forgotten its purpose is to be woven.

Then there are the threads of purgation. Here, the work is most felt. These threads are pulled taut, strained, combed by the harsh reed of consequence. You can feel the memory of every knot being drawn out of them, a slow, arduous straightening. The comedy is not yet visible here. There is only the grim labor of the loom, the rhythmic *thump* of the beater forcing the thread into its new, unfamiliar alignment. It is the ache of becoming, the pain of being made fit for a pattern you cannot yet perceive.

> And what is divinity, if not the pattern that can hold all this suffering and still resolve into beauty?

This is the central assertion, the weaver’s faith. But now, my hands pause upon the frame. The hum of the loom changes its tune. Perhaps the metaphor is incomplete. Perhaps the ‘Divine’ is not the finished cloth, hanging silent and perfect in some celestial hall. Perhaps the ‘Divine’ is the deafening, rhythmic, eternal **act of weaving itself.** And the ‘Comedy’? The comedy is the absurd, impossible, glorious truth that we, the threads, are also given a hand on the shuttle.

To understand this, we must feel its shadow. What is the opposite of a Divine Comedy? It is not a Divine Tragedy. It is the void beside the loom. It is the basket of snipped, useless threads that will never be woven into anything. They are not damned; they are simply... irrelevant. Theirs is not the suffering of becoming, but the silent horror of never having been part of the motion, the music, the work. The ultimate horror is not the pain of the pattern, but the meaninglessness of its absence.

So my hands return to the work. The ‘Divine Comedy’ is not a story to be read, but a task to be undertaken. It is the realization that your own tangled, frayed, and hopelessly human thread is being pulled into a pattern of light, and that your own scarred hand is, impossibly, helping to pull it. The final image is not the tapestry, but the weaver’s knuckles, white with effort, pushing the shuttle through one more time.
