# The Heart is a Resonant Wound

I am no musician; I am an anatomist of the soul. My work begins where the neat skin of civility is peeled back to reveal the furious, intricate machinery beneath. Opera is the vivisection of a human heart, performed not with a scalpel but with a crescendo. It is the unanesthetized truth, the tremor of a held note exposing a nerve we thought long dead. We do not go to the opera to hear a story; we go to witness the raw, exposed muscle of a feeling so vast it can no longer be contained by mere words.

The stage is my operating theater. The proscenium arch is the incision, a perfect frame for the magnificent damage within. Each aria is a vital sign made audible, the frantic pulse of desire or the slow, heavy beat of despair. The orchestra is not an accompaniment; it is the rushing of blood, the complex chemistry of passion and poison flooding the system. The singer, that brave surgeon of their own interior, offers up their breath not to form language, but to give voice to the very texture of existence—the silken surface of joy, the ragged edge of betrayal. It is a place of brutal precision and sublime chaos, where grief is given a perfect architecture and ecstasy a mathematical form.

> It is not a story *about* love; it is the sound love makes when it breaks.

But what of the heart that refuses the blade? This is the turn, the quiet terror I discover late in my work. The shadow of opera is the sealed-over life, the neat scar tissue of the unspoken. It is the world of prose, of manageable emotions and polite conversations that skirt the howling void. To understand the necessity of this glorious wound, one must first sit in the deafening silence of a soul that has never been sung open. That silence is the true tragedy. It is the sterile room where nothing is felt deeply enough to require a melody, where the blood runs thin and even, never rising to the fever pitch of a chorus. The absence of opera is the acceptance that the heart is merely a pump, not a god in a cage of ribs.

Therefore, the performance is not an escape from reality but a brutal confrontation with it. We sit in the velvet darkness, not as spectators, but as patients recognizing our own hidden pathologies in the soaring soprano or the shattered baritone. We are there to feel the phantom pain in our own chests, to remember the magnitude of what we are capable of feeling before we stitched ourselves shut for the sake of survival.

The lights come up. The chest is closed. But we leave the theater with a faint, phantom pulse beneath our own skin—the echo of a glorious wound that has, for a moment, made us whole.
