# A Liturgy for an Empty Room

I am an architect of acoustics, and I build only one kind of room. It is a chamber of cast concrete, seamless and severe, with no windows to admit the light and no doors to promise an escape. Into this space, I release a single, pure sound: a cry of unadulterated joy. It is a sound without language, a raw frequency of elation. **And the room is its cage.** This is my work—to observe the brutal interaction between ecstasy and its brutalist container, to map the terrain of a Joy Division.

The division is not an act of silence; it is an act of replication. The original joy, so brief and singular, strikes the first wall and does not die. It is fractured. It is returned. The concrete planes, the unyielding right angles, they are the division—a system that shatters the pure signal into a thousand brittle reports. The warmth of the initial cry is stripped away by the cold stone, its organic arc straightened into a ricochet. What returns to the center of the room is no longer joy, but its hollow, rhythmic ghost. *This is its function*: to take a feeling and turn it into a pattern, to transmute a momentary release into a percussive, unending echo that catalogs its own decay. The joy is never erased, but it is forced to listen to its own slow death, over and over, in a choir of its own making.

For a long time, I believed my work was a cruelty—an exercise in containing the beautiful until it becomes monstrous. I saw the division as a violence enacted upon the joy, a cold geometry meant to prove that no feeling can survive the hard architecture of reality. The room was a thesis on despair.

But I have come to understand the void outside the walls. I have imagined that same cry of joy released into an open field, under a limitless sky. There, it would travel outwards, thinning into nothing, absorbed by the vast, soft emptiness. It would be pure, yes. And it would be gone. Utterly and immediately forgotten, leaving no trace upon the air. The division, the merciless structure I built, is not merely a prison. It is a form of memory.

> What is a shout without an echo to prove it was ever uttered?

The concrete walls, in their harshness, grant the joy a terrible permanence. They refuse to let it simply vanish. By breaking it, they give it shape. By containing it, they give it a duration it would never otherwise know. The joy becomes a haunting, a presence that fills the space long after the initial impulse has faded. The division is the scar that proves the feeling was real.

And so I remain in my quiet observation. I no longer listen for the original sound, which is always too fleeting to hold. I listen for the echo. I listen for the rhythm of the decay, for the mathematical sorrow of the ricochet. The sound is gone. The hum of the geometry remains.
