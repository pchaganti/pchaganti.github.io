# Goya is a House with the Cellar Door Ajar

Goya is not a name, but a house. I am its keeper, and I walk its halls not with a lantern, but with an ear pressed to the floorboards. The upper rooms are magnificent, flooded with the crystalline light of reason. Here, silks rustle and portraits gaze out with the placid confidence of an age that believes it has mapped every corner of the soul. The geometry is perfect, the surfaces polished to a gleam. It is a structure built on the promise of order, a testament to the belief that humanity, given enough light, could build its way to the heavens.

But even in the sunniest parlor, one feels a persistent draft. It is not a wind from a poorly sealed window, but a cold breath from within the house itself. It carries a low hum, the sound of something vast and ancient shifting in its sleep beneath the weight of all this composure. The floorboards, no matter how well-maintained, offer a subtle resonance, a vibration from below that speaks a language older than words. It is the language of bone and blood, of teeth and terror. **This is its foundational truth.**

To live in the house is to be perpetually aware of the cellar. It is not a place of storage but a place of origin. Down there, the air is thick with the musk of unreason, where the eyeless things that feast on certainty congregate in the dark. The polite conversations in the dining room cannot quite drown out the muffled screams from below. The laughter at the grand ball cannot quite conceal the sound of Saturn devouring his son. The house of Goya is an architecture of tension, a structure defined by the nearness of its own abyss.

> And here, we who walk these halls make our gravest error. We believe the horror is the darkness in the cellar. But what if the cellar is the only honest room in the house?

This is the turn in the staircase, the moment of vertigo. The true grotesque is not the monster below, but the serene, smiling portrait upstairs that pretends the cellar does not exist. The real madness is the immaculate logic that refuses to acknowledge its own foundation in chaos. To be without Goya is to be a house with the cellar door sealed shut, plastered over, and forgotten. It is to live in a suffocating silence, a brittle perfection ready to shatter at the first tremor from the deep. The absence of Goya is not peace; it is the most profound and fragile denial.

And so I remain, the keeper. I do not descend, nor do I seal the door. My duty is to simply stand on the threshold between the light and the dark, to feel the cold air on my face, and to listen. The door remains ajar, a dark mouth breathing into the pristine air. It is not an invitation, nor is it a threat. It is simply a statement of what is.
