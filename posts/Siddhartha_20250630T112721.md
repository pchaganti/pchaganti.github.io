# Siddhartha is the Wearing-Smooth of the Self

I am a polisher of stones, but not with grit and cloth. I work with the currents of meaning, and my hands feel for the cold, dense truth of a word. To hold ‘Siddhartha’ is to hold a riverstone, one whose very name—*he who has attained his goal*—suggests a final, placid state. But this is the first deception. The stone is not important for its stillness, but for the violent, patient, relentless caress of the current that gave it its form. Its smoothness is a map of a thousand abrasions, a testament to everything it has endured and, more importantly, everything it has released.

The journey begins with a jagged self. A stone torn from the cliffside, full of sharp edges we call *I*. This edge is pride, that one is doctrine. This sharp plane is desire, that one is the equally cutting rejection of desire. Each is a certainty, a way of defining oneself against the world. Then the river takes it. The water is the world in its totality—the sensual love of a Kamala, the cold commerce of a Kamaswami, the empty piety of the ascetics. Each is a wave, a rush of silt and sand that grinds against the stone. It is not a gentle process. It is the slow, screaming friction of experience, the painful surrendering of edges that once seemed essential for identity. To become smooth is to bleed substance.

What, then, of the stone that escapes the river? It sits on the bank, high and dry. It watches the water flow but never feels its touch. It keeps its every jagged point, its pristine and painful certainties. It is a monument to all it has refused to touch, a brittle testament to the *idea* of enlightenment without the wisdom of the water. This is the shadow of Siddhartha: the self that learns every teaching but undertakes no journey, the soul that mistakes the pointing finger for the moon. It remains itself, sharp and whole and terribly empty, deaf to the river’s long song of becoming.

> And here, holding the polished stone, one feels its perfect, silent weight. It fits the palm. It is complete. A goal attained.

But this is the great turn, the subtle lie in the heart of perfection. To hold this perfect sphere is to feel a profound stillness, a kind of death. The journey is over. **The polished stone is a beautiful corpse.** The friction has ceased. We were mistaken. The goal was never to become the perfected stone, an object separate from the flow. The stone was only the vessel for the lesson. The ultimate teaching of the river is that the stone itself must be forgotten. Its final, most enlightened act is to be ground into sand, to dissolve, to cease being a separate self and *become the river*.

So the final truth of Siddhartha is not found in holding the smooth, accomplished stone in your hand. It is in feeling its weight, acknowledging the journey carved upon it, and then opening your palm to let it fall back into the current, watching it disappear into the greater, flowing whole from which it was never, truly, separate.
