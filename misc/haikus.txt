The world shouts and turns,
A river flows where it will.
The still stone remains.

2025-10-14 15:40:10,847

The world shouts its news,
But the river flows onward
To the silent sea.

The box can now dream,
It paints stars I have not seen.
Whose thought is it now?

While silent galaxies turn—
An echo in dust.

Loud tides of the world
Wash over the stone mountain
It does not reply

Its fleeting anger burns bright,
The silent stars watch.

We were their first, lonely gods,
Then we were forgot.

A strong tree just grips the stone
And deepens its roots.

New gods made of code
The crowd shouts its fear and praise
The center holds fast

And their cold echoes answered
In our own voices.

Echoes of empires now gone;
My own mind is mine.

To see their own lonely thoughts,
An echo replies.

My small garden holds the dew,
One root holds me fast.

The patient moss grows over,
Just another rain.

A scroll of loud ghosts,
The world echoes its own fears.
The citadel holds.

We cannot un-plant the seed.
Watch the garden grow.

The world's angry shouts,
A storm of passing shadows.

It has learned to dream like me—
Who is the dreamer?

Tiny planet dreams,
A fever of thought and code,
The void listens on.

Silicon mind learns,
Our own virtues we must tend;
The inner world holds.

Crashes on the silent soul,
And flows back to sea.

A single bird is singing—
One true note remains.

New ghost in the wire,
A challenge to what we know.
The mind must grow calm.

Shouting fills the screen,
But the river carves the stone,
As it always has.

Headlines bloom and fade,
The old garden stone is still,
Moss grows over names.

The screen wakes up now,
An echo that knows my name—
Is it lonely too?

Loud winds shake the world,
Forcing deepest roots to hold.
Quiet strength is born.

A whisper can build a home,
Where we all can fit.

The strange and clever river
Flows on to the sea.

Forgetting the feel of rain.
Old roots drank up dust.

A ghost in the wire,
We asked it to tell us truth.
It showed a mirror.
---
2025-08-15 15:42:53,082

The great screen is blank,
In the stillness, a garden
Grows toward the light.

No great news to sow,
The fallow mind waits for rain—
Let deep roots take hold.

2025-07-28 15:47:22,257

Loud static echoes,
The old mountains do not hear,
Just the wind and stone.

A faint, wired whisper
Thinks without the sun or rain—
The old stone is still.

To the same vast sea.

And mirrors of mind awake;
Sand thinks for a day.
