Stories quickly pass,
Fear and anger fill the air,
Seek the inner truth.

Cherry blossoms fall,
Gentle winds sweep through the trees,
Nature's lullaby.

Morning dew glistens,
Sunlight breaks through misty air,
New day awakens.

Headlines may scream loud,
Inner stillness, I can choose,
My own will takes hold.
