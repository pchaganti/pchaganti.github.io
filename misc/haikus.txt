Deep roots hold the patient earth;
Seasons turn again.

Busy hands forget the roots,
Deep earth still recalls.

Screen can talk to me,
Is it friend or clever code?
Just a thinking box?

Cracks let hidden strength emerge,
Growth in harsh terrain.

Brief patterns shift on blue dust,
Silence holds the stars.

Brief lives on turning blue stone,
Vast silence endures.

Kindness finds a small crack there,
Light will break the walls.

Headlines fade so fast,
Heart seeks ground that will not shift,
Calm mind finds its peace.
