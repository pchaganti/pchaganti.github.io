World screams, never stops,
But deep breath finds the quiet core,
Peace within remains.

Vast screen flickers bright,
Fleeting dramas, human cries,
Dust motes dance in void.

Walls rise in the news,
Kindness finds a small crack there,
Light will break the walls.

Headlines fade so fast,
Heart seeks ground that will not shift,
Calm mind finds its peace.
