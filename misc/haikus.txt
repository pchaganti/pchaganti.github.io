Vast screen flickers bright,
Fleeting dramas, human cries,
Dust motes dance in void.

Walls rise in the news,
Kindness finds a small crack there,
Light will break the walls.

No tidings arrive,
Yet the spirit finds its calm,
Virtue is enough.

Strong winds fiercely blow,
Trees may bend, but never break,
Life finds strength to grow.

Headlines fade so fast,
Heart seeks ground that will not shift,
Calm mind finds its peace.
