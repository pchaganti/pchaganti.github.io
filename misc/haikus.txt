Small waves on time's endless sea.
Vast sky looks beyond.

World's noise rushes past,
Still waters reflect the sky,
Deep roots hold the ground.

Small sparks rage below,
Brief lives on turning blue stone,
Vast silence endures.

Vast screen flickers bright,
Fleeting dramas, human cries,
Dust motes dance in void.

Walls rise in the news,
Kindness finds a small crack there,
Light will break the walls.

Headlines fade so fast,
Heart seeks ground that will not shift,
Calm mind finds its peace.
