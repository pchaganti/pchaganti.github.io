      "title": "eFlesh: Highly customizable Magnetic Touch Sensing using Cut-Cell\n  Microstructures",
      "summary": "If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured\nenvironments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces\nduring physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and\neasily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific\nsolutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,\nsensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a\nmagnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly\ncustomizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a\nhobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired\nshape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,\nparameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and\nits mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts\nconvex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular\ndesign framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to\nadjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization\nexperiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE\nof 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for\nshear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to\nunseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that\nimprove manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving\n91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy\nfor successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL\nconversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.",

      "summary": "We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking\nthe following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically\ninteracting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating\nobjects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound\npairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their\ncorresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other\nactions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their\ncorresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds\naccurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often\nindistinguishable to human observers from real sounds.

In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward\nframework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.\nOur approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively\ncompresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and\ntemporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable\nhigh-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based\ntraining strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute\nthe DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text\nannotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates\nsemantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,\nsignificantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.\nOur work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more\naccessible and practical.

      "summary": "Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality\nand efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all\nparts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual\nparts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of\nparts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D\nobject generation. Given a single input image, our method generates\nhigh-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically\nmeaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes\nall parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete\nand interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show\nthat our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than\nprevious image-based part-level generation methods.",

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,\nlarge-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly\nexpands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new\nquestion-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We\ndeveloped a systematic method using large language models to generate these\nquestions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's\ninference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world\nclinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations\nthat mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two\nmain evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test\nmodel robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more\nchallenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate\nthe development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in\nclinical settings.

      "title": "Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models",
      "summary": "Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across\na range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution\nhas opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative\nlearning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the\nclass-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to\nextracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify\nCanonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM\nfeatures preserve essential categorical information while discarding\nnon-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative\nsamples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the\ncore class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we\ndevelop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While\nthe student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers\ncore class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the\ntraining data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial\nrobustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals\ninstead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve\nnot just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that\ncan drive robust representation learning.",

Currently,\nthere are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally\neffective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we\nintroduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be\nseamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any\narchitecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training\ntask and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling\nprecise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further\nregulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus\ntoward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image\nmodels to incorporate well-established texture knowledge.

However, best practices for RL in\ninstruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the\nverification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a\nverification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based\nverification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this\napproach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,\nVerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated\nverification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving\nsignificant improvements across several representative instruction-following\nbenchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models\nof comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further\nobserve that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL\nwith VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model\nperformance.

      "summary": "Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical\ntweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number\nscaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom\nmovement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the\nability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but\npreviously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and\nre-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining\ncoherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that\ninclude single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement\nwhile compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up\nto 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine\nmidcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional\nbranching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell\nstate. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer\narray from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a\nkey step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the\nlifetime of an atom in the system.",

      "title": "From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of\n  Vision-Language-Action Models",
      "summary": "One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional\nimitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization\ncapabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,\n\"generalist\" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code\nto serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on\nclosing the perception-to-action gap.

      "summary": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class\nwithout any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For\nlarge-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform\nsuperpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,\nexisting GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,\nand the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of\ndifferent class semantics during information aggregation. To address these\nchallenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator\n(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their\nrepresentation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral\nfeatures. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)\nmodule that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel\ntopological graph.

      "summary": "Metric learning has attracted extensive interest for its ability to provide\npersonalized recommendations based on the importance of observed user-item\ninteractions. Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away\nfrom the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical\ndistance margin. However, items may come from imbalanced categories with\ndifferent intra-class variations. Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be\nideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced\nitems. To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant\nmetric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which\nmaps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up\nthe online recommendation. Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant\nmargin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming\nsubspace. Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the\nmargin. To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a\npairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model. Due\nto the difficulty of directly optimizing the mixed integer optimization problem\nformulated with \\textit{log-sum-exp} functions, we seek to optimize its\nvariational quadratic upper bound and learn hash codes with an alternating\noptimization strategy.
