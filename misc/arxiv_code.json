      "title": "Delta Activations: A Representation for Finetuned Large Language Models",
      "summary": "The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled\nthe community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to\nspecific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models\nremains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.\nWe introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as\nvector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to\na base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and\ntask, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also\ndemonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and\nexhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,\nwe show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and\nfurther explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta\nActivations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations.",

      "title": "ArcMemo: Abstract Reasoning Composition with Lifelong LLM Memory",
      "summary": "While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and\ncapable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these\ntraces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new\nquery. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and\nrecent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we\nconfirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an\notherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting\nthe hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to\nmemory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

      "title": "The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models",
      "summary": "Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding\n(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened\na new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

      "title": "Design and Development of a Web Platform for Blood Donation Management",
      "summary": "Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable\ndonors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper\npresents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a\nweb-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a\ncentralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register\ntheir personal information, including blood group, contact details, and\navailability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,\nand the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The\nplatform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams\nto ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web\ntechnologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and\nMySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a\ndynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor\nrefgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces\ndelays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood\nand enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.",

      "title": "No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in\n  Resume Screening",
      "summary": "In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people\ncollaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)\nto evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This\nwork has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,\ndesign and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias\nin collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and\nregulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision\nmaking when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and\ndetermining which are subject to oversight.",

      "title": "Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective",
      "summary": "A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion\nmodels achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,\nwhile efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality\nceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from\nrestrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal\ndynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by\nintroducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically\ndefines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a\nnovel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to\narbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory\nfrom single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having\nonly 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing\nleading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across\nall evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,\nTiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget\nincreases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM\ndelivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.",

      "title": "Cosmic Ray Magnetohydrodynamics: A New Two-Moment Framework with\n  Numerical Implementation",
      "summary": "Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in various astrophysical systems,\ndelivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR\ntransport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and\ncomplex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have\nalleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback.\nYet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all\nrelevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively\ndepends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges\npersist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver\ndesign for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment\ndescription for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR\nstreaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\\'en\nwaves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a\ngeneral framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this\nframework as a new CR fluid module in the \\textit{Athena}++ code, and validate\nit through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full\ndispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the\nCR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves\nserve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds\nin our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical\ninstabilities arising from streaming source terms.",

      "summary": "We developed a numerical code which evolves the semiclassical Einstein's\nequation (with the quantum stress-energy contribution added as a source term)\nfor the spherically symmetric metric inside an evaporating semiclassical\ncharged black hole. An analytical approximation for the evolving semiclassical\nmetric was recently developed by Ori and Zilberman (and will be briefly\noverviewed here). We seek to numerically check the validity of this analytical\napproximation. The Einstein equations in this case are partial differential\nequations for the two unknown metric functions which fully describe the\nspherically symmetric metric. We begin our numerical simulation close to the\nevent horizon with regular initial data specified by a variant of the charged\nVaidya metric. We then evolve the metric functions deep into the neighborhood\nof the inner horizon. We explore the results of running this numerical code in\nseveral representative cases. Our numerical simulations confirm the validity of\nthe above mentioned analytical approximation in all these cases.",

      "title": "AnomalyLMM: Bridging Generative Knowledge and Discriminative Retrieval\n  for Text-Based Person Anomaly Search",
      "summary": "With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has\nemerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal\nbehaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,\nthis task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal\nalignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly\nrecognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose\nAnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person\nanomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline\nintegrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric\nanomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked\ncross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware\nre-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study\nto explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB\ndataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly\nsearch, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,\nfalling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1\naccuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual\nanomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code\nand models will be released for future research.",
