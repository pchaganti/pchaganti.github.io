      "title": "Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level",
      "summary": "Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale\nremains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

      "title": "The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and\n  Evaluation",
      "summary": "Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard\nbenchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their\ngeneralization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

      "title": "Gistify! Codebase-Level Understanding via Runtime Execution",
      "summary": "As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to\nautomatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We\npropose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,\nself-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.\nThe coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific\nentrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the\noutput of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only\nthe essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on\nGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate\nmodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially\nlarge code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models\nstruggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions\ntraces.",

      "title": "Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often\nsuffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and\ninference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue\nthrough algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its\nroot cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted\nBF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that\nbreaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that simply reverting to \\textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this\nmismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only\na few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model\narchitecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16\nuniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger\nperformance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these\nfindings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL\nfine-tuning.",

      "title": "HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies",
      "summary": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

      "title": "LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads",
      "summary": "We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in\nLLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal\nrepresentation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic\n\"filter\" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on\na diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of\nattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of\nthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate\nthat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted\nand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,\npresented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also\nidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for\nfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing\nthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our\nresults reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable\nimplementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways\nthat are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional\nprogramming patterns.",

      "summary": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of\nirreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research\nfocuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,\na non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM\nchallenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images\nresearch competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our\nevaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we\nevaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's\narchitecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,\nencoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized\nloss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main\noutcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection\nframework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the\nmulti-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB\nfundus images.

      "title": "Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the\n  chaos bound",
      "summary": "Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental\naspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely\nindependently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we\nestablish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy\nof time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix\nansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show\nthat the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum\nerror-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between\ninformation scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we\nderive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on\nfluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error\nand the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos\nconstrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.",

This\nenables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be\nunattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of\nstrategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world\nexperiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success\nrate in grasping a falling pen task.

      "title": "Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative\n  Assessment",
      "summary": "Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,\nsecurity vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,\nupdating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone\nprocess. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding\nsystems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this\npaper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,\nacross a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's\nCopilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing\nmulti-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated\nmigration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the\nproportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study\nshow that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages\nbetween SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to\nmaintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate\n(39.75%, median).",
