      "summary": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models\nshow great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is\nessential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that\nCBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution\nshifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce\nSUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic\nimages based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33\nbird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific\nconcept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied\nDiffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where\nnoise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the\ncorrect bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel\nbenchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,\ncontributing to the development of more robust methods.

      "title": "MonoFusion: Sparse-View 4D Reconstruction via Monocular Fusion",
      "summary": "We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view\nvideos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are\nprohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.\nIn contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a\nbike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene\ncoverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive\nexperiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method\nachieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when\nrendering novel views.

      "summary": "Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically\nprecise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of\nthousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial\nlatency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for\nauto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,\nmulti-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel\nwithin a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further\npropose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies\neach predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality\ncriteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the\nlightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging\ntheir prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of\nspeculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will\nbe released.",

      "summary": "The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a\nchallenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for\na given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally\nanswered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and\ntime-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in\nthe candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian\ninference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is\ncollected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark\ntasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing\nmethods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation\neffort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art.

      "title": "Slot Attention with Re-Initialization and Self-Distillation",
      "summary": "Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning\n(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,\ntermed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.\nOCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying\ncompetitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the\nquery. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing\nredundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This\noften results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,\nmainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into\nthe input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal\ninformation. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with\nre-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\\emph{i)}$ We reduce\nredundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to\nupdate the remaining slots; $\\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the\nfirst aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to\nenable self-distillation.

To address this limitation, we build a large-scale\ngrasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like\ninstructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k\nreasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as\nwild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully\nannotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions\nis largely increased by removing their category name and only providing\nfunctional descriptions.

      "title": "DiffuMatch: Category-Agnostic Spectral Diffusion Priors for Robust\n  Non-rigid Shape Matching",
      "summary": "Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving\nnon-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

      "summary": "We suggest a re-examination of the conventional view that hybrid\noptical-radio frequency (O-RF) systems are primarily diversity-driven networks\nthat switch between RF and optical links for robustness. Instead, we uncover a\nnew architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable\nreal-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder\nfeedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter's coding\nstrategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link\ndiversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband,\ninterference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a\ndownlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this\nvision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback\n(O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive\nRF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant\nuplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight\nthat inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full\npotential of hybrid wireless networks.",

      "summary": "While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a\ncritical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying\ntemporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require\nfine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation\nhorizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we\nsystematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We\nfirst demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when\ntransferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the\ntemporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit\nconditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.\nBased on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model\npre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset.

While past studies have examined CR delays and\niteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code\nchanges required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),\nwhich remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as\nthe amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600\nMRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require\nadjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200\nlines of code.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy.

      "summary": "Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely\napplied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process.

      "summary": "The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the\ndevelopment of robust detection methods capable of identifying\nmachine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection\nthrough adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on\nstatistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise\nthat falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts\ncharacteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper\nintroduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the\nstatistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the\nreplacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy\nscore derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically\ngrounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit\nsignificant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions\ninadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the\nlog-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,\nproviding superior resilience to statistical outliers.
