      "title": "ARB: A Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark",
      "summary": "As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing\ninterest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.\nHowever, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with\nrich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we\nintroduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the\nfirst benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across\nboth textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including\nvisual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and\ncultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with\n5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12\nstate-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges\nin coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured\nframework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and\nmarks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI\nsystems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support\nfuture research and reproducibility. Code available at:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/ARB",

      "title": "GoT-R1: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of MLLM for Visual Generation\n  with Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic\nimages from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify\nmultiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective\nhandling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content\nand spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement\nlearning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building\nupon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to\nautonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined\ntemplates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,\nwe propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs\nto evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective\nsupervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses\nsemantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench\nbenchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial\nrelationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in\nimage generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning\ncapabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we\nmake our code and pretrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/gogoduan/GoT-R1.",

      "title": "SophiaVL-R1: Reinforcing MLLMs Reasoning with Thinking Reward",
      "summary": "Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement\nlearning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks\nsupervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,\nthe model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its\ngeneralization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt\nto add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve\nthis, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the\nentire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for\ncertain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which\nassigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This\nweight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading\nto correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of\npotentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing\ntraining strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,\nallowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in\nlater training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series\nof reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),\ndemonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our\nSophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite\nthe latter having 10 times more parameters. All code, models, and datasets are\nmade publicly available at https://github.com/kxfan2002/SophiaVL-R1.",

      "title": "Let Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: A Human-like Image Implication\n  Understanding and Reasoning Framework",
      "summary": "Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI\nsystems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,\nand contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they\nstruggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual\ngaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their\nabstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let\nAndroids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and\nreasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:\n(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual\nrepresentations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain\nknowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment\nimage implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight\nGPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English\nimage implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,\nperforming comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)\nand outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work\nprovides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image\nimplications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI\ninteraction.

      "title": "Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO",
      "summary": "Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.
