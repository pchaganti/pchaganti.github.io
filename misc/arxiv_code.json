      "title": "ARB: A Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark",
      "summary": "As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing\ninterest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.\nHowever, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with\nrich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we\nintroduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the\nfirst benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across\nboth textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including\nvisual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and\ncultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with\n5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12\nstate-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges\nin coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured\nframework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and\nmarks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI\nsystems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support\nfuture research and reproducibility. Code available at:\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/ARB",

      "summary": "Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic\nimages from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify\nmultiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective\nhandling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content\nand spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement\nlearning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building\nupon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to\nautonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined\ntemplates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,\nwe propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs\nto evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective\nsupervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses\nsemantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench\nbenchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial\nrelationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in\nimage generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning\ncapabilities to the visual generation domain.

      "title": "SophiaVL-R1: Reinforcing MLLMs Reasoning with Thinking Reward",
      "summary": "Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement\nlearning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks\nsupervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,\nthe model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its\ngeneralization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt\nto add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve\nthis, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the\nentire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for\ncertain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which\nassigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This\nweight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading\nto correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of\npotentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing\ntraining strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,\nallowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in\nlater training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series\nof reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),\ndemonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our\nSophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite\nthe latter having 10 times more parameters.

      "summary": "Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI\nsystems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,\nand contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they\nstruggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual\ngaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their\nabstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let\nAndroids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and\nreasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:\n(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual\nrepresentations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain\nknowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment\nimage implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight\nGPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English\nimage implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,\nperforming comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)\nand outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ).

      "title": "Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO",
      "summary": "Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.

      "summary": "We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can\nflexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok\nis equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens\nof each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the\nreconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens.\nDuring inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear\nprogramming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores.\nSuch design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token\nallocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video\nreconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok\nconsistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under\ndifferent token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient\ngenerative video modeling.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting\nexternal information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,\nor ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce\nR1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage\nboth internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage\ntraining strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format\nlearning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses\noutcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism\nfor internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to\ncontinuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's\ninternal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search\nengine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient\nretrieval-augmented reasoning.

This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model\nand plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an\nunconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator\narchitectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse\nobservation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous\nmathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling\napproach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in\nfunction spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five\nPDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy\nimprovement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while\nreducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning\nensures strong cross-resolution generalizability.

Nevertheless, most existing\nresearch focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable\nreasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still\nlimited.

      "summary": "In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete\ndiffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal\nperformance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we\ndesign a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase\nwith a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model,\ntrained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as\nLLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%,\ndemonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of\nautoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding\nstrategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of\ntokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation\niterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during\ngeneration equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the\nnumber of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\\frac{\\text{response\nlength}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive\nmodels and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on\nmost benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x.\nAdditionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response\nusing structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner\ndistinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow\nfine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to\nachieve in autoregressive models.

All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as\nopen source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility,\nand LLM-guided hardware translation. Dataset and benchmark are on\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/cass}{\\textcolor{blue}{HuggingFace}},\nwith code at\n\\href{https://github.com/GustavoStahl/CASS}{\\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}.",

      "title": "Fixing Data That Hurts Performance: Cascading LLMs to Relabel Hard\n  Negatives for Robust Information Retrieval",
      "summary": "Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale\nretrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million\nquery-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that\ncertain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of\n15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by\n2.35$\\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a\ndeeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on \"false\nnegatives\", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We\npropose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to\nidentify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling\nfalse negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B\nretrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot\nAIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on\nthe relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the\ncascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we\nfind judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than\nGPT-4o-mini.",
