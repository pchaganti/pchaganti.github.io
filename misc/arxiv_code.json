      "title": "Layer-Aware Representation Filtering: Purifying Finetuning Data to\n  Preserve LLM Safety Alignment",
      "summary": "With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning\naligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world\napplications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important\nthan ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even\nwhen fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of\naligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious\ninstructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain\nsamples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the\nsurface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs\nduring fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a\n\\textbf{L}ayer-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{R}epresentation \\textbf{F}iltering\nmethod. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and\nleverages their representations to detect which data samples in the\npost-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with\nsafety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment\ndegradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF}{https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF}.",
