      "title": "Hierarchical Rectified Flow Matching with Mini-Batch Couplings",
      "summary": "Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that\nis widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch\ncouplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on\nsynthetic and imaging data.

      "title": "VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.",

      "title": "$Ï€^3$: Scalable Permutation-Equivariant Visual Geometry Learning",
      "summary": "We introduce $\\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel\napproach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a\nconventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their\nreconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to\ninstability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\\pi^3$\nemploys a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict\naffine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any\nreference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input\nordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free\napproach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,\nincluding camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense\npoint map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.",

      "title": "Imbalance in Balance: Online Concept Balancing in Generation Models",
      "summary": "In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex\nconcepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an\nunder-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors\nfor poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also\ndesign a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this\nissue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset\nprocessing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex\nconcept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method\nsignificantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and\nyields highly competitive results with only a few codes.",

      "title": "Expansion creates spin-glass order in finite-connectivity models: a\n  rigorous and intuitive approach from the theory of LDPC codes",
      "summary": "Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large\nbarriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical\nsystems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry\nbreaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for\ncertain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a\nrigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models\nwith local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.\nTo this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the\nmathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check\n(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees\nextensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional\nassumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the\nlow-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an\nasymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the\nlandscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of\nthe total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --\nwhich we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and\ntreats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those\nwith short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our\nresults apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,\nand while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family\nof codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random\nregular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both\nmodels undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to\nthe onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.",
