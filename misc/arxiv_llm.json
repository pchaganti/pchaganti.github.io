      "title": "Adacc: Adaptive Compression and Activation Checkpointing for LLM Memory\n  Management",
      "summary": "Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate\nmemory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework\nthat combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the\nGPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific\ncompression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of\ndirectly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We\npropose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best\nmemory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training\ntensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the\npolicy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that\nAdacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the\nBaseline.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts\nwhere fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially\nconcerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for\nresponsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed\nsignificant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but\nwas constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we\nintroduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'\npronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,\nDeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender\nidentity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with\nprevious studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.\nHowever, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains\ninconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning.

      "summary": "Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct\nchallenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques\ndesigned to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection\ncapabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English\ndatasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese\ncontext. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal\nframework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated\nwith directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive\nthree-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a\nshared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy\nto enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in\nseveral Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses\nfine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing\nin-context learning approaches.",

      "summary": "Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial\nintelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility.",

      "summary": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language\nqueries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging\ntheir relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on\ninternal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook\na core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions\nand judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic\ncourtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,\nrelevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases.

Despite the widespread use of\nthis technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in\nterms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims:\nThis study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and\nhuman-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding\ntasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and\nSonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions.

To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,\nand audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing\nevaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies\ngood from broken or mismatched content.\n  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a\nbank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects\nrelevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify\nthe best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback\nfrom the AVR.\n  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content\nA against B).

Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical\nexperts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,\ndiagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its\npractical potential to enhance patient information collection.",
