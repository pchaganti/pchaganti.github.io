      "title": "A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models",
      "summary": "In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for\nreasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for\nbroader reasoning models. Github:\nhttps://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs",

      "title": "Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs\n  for Text Annotation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research\nby enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and\ntext analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,\nanything can be presented as statistically significant.",

      "summary": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the\nquality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work\nhas centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct\neffective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for\nbuilding web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token\ncorpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade\ncorpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data\nselection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when\ntransitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our\nfindings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,\nincluding classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to\nthe target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the\nimportance of high-quality, language-specific data.

      "title": "Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation\n  Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have\nsignificantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.\nHowever, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in\ndynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and\nconventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nagentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy\nteacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on\noracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback\nmechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate\nthe consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability\nof LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent\n(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only\nquantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user\npreferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the\nidentification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to\nten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a\nstrong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential\ntool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.",

      "summary": "The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable\nfact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in\nautomating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts\nremains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across\nmultiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures,\nreasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional\nfact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model\ngeneralizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting\nstrategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions,\nwith over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a\nconcerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible\nmodels show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models\ndemonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in\ninformation verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use\nsmaller models.

      "summary": "Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent\ndecisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents.",

To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced\nMulti-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization\nprocess is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:\nknowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained\noptimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,\nLLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing\nchemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in\nthe data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process\nwithin these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby\nimproving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark\nevaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances\noptimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.\nImportantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab\nexperiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting\nconditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical\nreaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value\nof 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.\nThis real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark\nevaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical\ndiscovery.",

Existing methods on\nautomating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from\nlow success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within\nexisting Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported\nproblems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and\nalso the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce\nSWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,\nmirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and\nre-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing\nGym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on\nGitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable\ntasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have\ncurated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value\nof our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.\nPost-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit\nimprovements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the\ndataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the\nOpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on\nSWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and\nvalidates the effectiveness of our approach.",

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic\ndesign that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen.

With their increasing use in high\nrisk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their\noperational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.\nHowever, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires\nsignificant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we\nintroduce \\coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of\nsemantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized\nblack-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit\na uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding\nmanifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension\ntext-embedding latent space.

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic\nassistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.\nHowever, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical\ntraining data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications).

Our method\naggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic\nand Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers.

Our\nevaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and\nfeatures, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when\nhandling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects\nin longer videos.",

      "summary": "The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other\ndomains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of\nincreasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of\nmachine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these\ntools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on\nencoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we\ninvestigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with\nspecific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems\nin a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate\nstandard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results\nof previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be\ndeployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing\ncomplexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of\ncurrent-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection\nvia the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several\ncurrent models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated\nand their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based\nsystem to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions\nmirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.",
