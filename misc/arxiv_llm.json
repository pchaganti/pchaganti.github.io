      "title": "MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via\n  End-to-End Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM\ncontext, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,\nresulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead.

      "title": "Can LLMs subtract numbers?",
      "summary": "We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).\nWhile prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has\nreceived comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as\na non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four\nfamilies on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that\nsubtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the\nerrors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs\nfrequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing\nanalyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,\nyet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further\ntest well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to\nsee if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while\nfew-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve\nnear-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these\nfindings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and\nrecoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.",

      "summary": "Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy\nfor finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory\noverhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent\ncurse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the\nhigh-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a\nnovel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive\ndirectional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,\nConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.\nThis concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more\nlikely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,\nwhen finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than\nMeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains\nand come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM\nsystems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for\nevery input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In\nthis work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller\nLLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and\ncost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as\nreinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while\nminimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent\nsystem to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during\ninference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework\nthat optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget\nsetting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a\nsingle system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while\nmaintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and\ncost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.",

We reframe\nopen radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via\ncounterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an\naction-conditioned generative state space.

In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually\ntightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally\nmaster the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques\nin unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a\nsmoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on\nsimplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full\ndeployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a\nbinary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum\nstrategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes\nthe trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a\nmulti-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.\nThese results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the\nefficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory\nconstraints during deployment.

      "title": "Optimal Singular Damage: Efficient LLM Inference in Low Storage Regimes",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse\napplications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",

Our work\naddresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and\nconducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task\ntypes, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning\ntasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge\nreduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing\nexcessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of\nhallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar\ncontexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar\nquestions.

Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending\nagainst model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can\nbe achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.",
