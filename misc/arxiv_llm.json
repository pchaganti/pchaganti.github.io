      "title": "No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training\nlarge language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require\nextensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,\nReinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on\nintrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we\nleverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,\ntrajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthese internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate\nvarious RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs\nat the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques\non these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even\nbelow the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little\nimprovement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of\nintrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze\nthis limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's\ntraining behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal\nfeedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback\nwill inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.",

      "title": "Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency",
      "summary": "Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific\ndomain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,\nfine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even\nwhen the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider\nthis to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of\nfine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the \"attack\". Most\nwell-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM\nwith reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily\nexploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make\nany meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and\nreproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a\nsafety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and\nthe stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising\nvariance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly\ninconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations\nhave serious implications for how researchers in this field should report\nresults to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.",

However, one\nof the limitation that LLMs do not natively express uncertainty makes it\ndifficult to assess the reliability of their generated queries. This paper\npresents a case study that evaluates multiple approaches to estimate confidence\nscores for LLM-generated SQL in supply chain data retrieval. We investigated\nthree strategies: (1) translation-based consistency checks; (2) embedding-based\nsemantic similarity between user questions and generated SQL; and (3)\nself-reported confidence scores directly produced by the LLM. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs are often overconfident in their own outputs, which limits the\neffectiveness of self-reported confidence. In contrast, embedding-based\nsimilarity methods demonstrate strong discriminative power in identifying\ninaccurate SQL.",

      "title": "Detecting LLM-Generated Short Answers and Effects on Learner Performance",
      "summary": "The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised\nconcerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for\ndetecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and\neducators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of\ndetection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or\nevaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In\nthis study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those\nproduced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human\ncoders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess\nthe impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM\noutperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of\n80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1\nscore of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated\nresponses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open\nresponse question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the\ncorresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question\ntypes and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for\nfuture work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve\nLLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical\nindicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks,\nreadability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we\ncontribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for\nsimilar use cases.",

      "summary": "Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may\ndiffer in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.\nTo address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically\nevaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.\nMedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each\ntransformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping\nor gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial\ntone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or\nsummaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts\ngrounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three\nhuman expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies\nto reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect\ndiverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are\nmore sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are\nmore sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical\nsummaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go\nbeyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and\nLLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.",

      "summary": "Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on\nvisual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to\nprocess dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this\nvideo-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable\nby utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained\ndescriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,\ncontains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To\ndemonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides\ntimestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges\nspecializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding\nwindows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,\ngenerating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this\nlanguage-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match\nevents, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional\nvideo-based methods for action spotting.",

      "summary": "LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization\nof sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal\ncompliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques,\nwhich can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a\npost-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns.\nWhile recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language,\ntheir applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study\nreveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code,\ncause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable\nfor code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning\napproach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively\npreserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability\nof forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate\ndistributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget\nspecific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study,\nwe establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three\ncritical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code\nunlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that\nPROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility\ncompared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while\nconsistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series.\nPROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without\ngenerating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that\nour approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques\nto source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable\ncode generation.",

      "title": "When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?",
      "summary": "Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.",

However, their\neffectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL\ndeductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on\nestablished mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step\nFOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on\nour proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited\nexploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning\nmistakes to undermine entire proofs.

      "summary": "Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for\nreaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine\ntranslation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing\ngeneral-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and\ninstruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world\napplications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce\nTower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both\ntranslation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a\nPareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual\ngeneral-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds\non Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with\nverifiable rewards.

We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.\nOur smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and\nproprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers\nbest-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top\nresults in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we\nintroduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following.

This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal\nmechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving\nbehavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by\nassigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model\ncomponents. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer\nperceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual\nassociations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook\nthe impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for\nanalyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable\nAttention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping\narbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer\nmodels. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,\ncalculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the\nTopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We\nthen propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to\ndiminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module\nusing only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on\nconcepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their\ncorresponding modules.
