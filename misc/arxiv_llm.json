      "title": "CrossLMM: Decoupling Long Video Sequences from LMMs via Dual\n  Cross-Attention Mechanisms",
      "summary": "The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g.,\nimage and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with\nlong video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly,\nleading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient\ncompression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a\npressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling\nlong video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which\nsubstantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance\ndegradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction\nfrom pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM\nlayers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the\npooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.\nThis module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining\nfine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual\ncross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through\ninteraction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension\nof the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based\nLMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.",

      "title": "Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO",
      "summary": "Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to\nstatic knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting\nexternal information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,\nor ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce\nR1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage\nboth internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage\ntraining strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format\nlearning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses\noutcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism\nfor internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to\ncontinuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's\ninternal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search\nengine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient\nretrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++\noutperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient\nretrieval.

However, most existing\nMAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the\nsystem's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the\nparadigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by\ndiverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence\nof diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to\nevaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and\nMAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs\nacross 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over\n1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each\ndomain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that\ntransitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can\nsignificantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.\nSpecifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration\nyields up to 8.4\\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed\nchatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable\n47\\% performance boost on the AIME dataset.

      "summary": "Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved\nemotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still\npersist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing\nsuch errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC\ntasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing\nESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content,\nmaking it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2)\nOptimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data\nleads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce\nInferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data,\nforming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a\nDecoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion\nRegulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks:\nstrategy planning and empathic response generation.

We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced\nMultimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit\nreasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that\nall models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy\nfluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis\nfurther shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate\nevidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning\nchains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and\nmodalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,\nmulti-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI\nsystems.",
