      "title": "Recovered in Translation: Efficient Pipeline for Automated Translation of Benchmarks and Datasets",
      "summary": "The reliability of multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation is currently compromised by the inconsistent quality of translated benchmarks. Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development.",

      "title": "Codesigning Ripplet: an LLM-Assisted Assessment Authoring System Grounded in a Conceptual Model of Teachers' Workflows",
      "summary": "Assessments are critical in education, but creating them can be difficult. To address this challenge in a grounded way, we partnered with 13 teachers in a seven-month codesign process. We developed a conceptual model that characterizes the iterative dual process where teachers develop assessments while simultaneously refining requirements. To enact this model in practice, we built Ripplet, a web-based tool with multilevel reusable interactions to support assessment authoring. The extended codesign revealed that Ripplet enabled teachers to create formative assessments they would not have otherwise made, shifted their practices from generation to curation, and helped them reflect more on assessment quality. In a user study with 15 additional teachers, compared to their current practices, teachers felt the results were more worth their effort and that assessment quality improved.",

      "title": "LLMTailor: A Layer-wise Tailoring Tool for Efficient Checkpointing of Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Checkpointing is essential for fault tolerance in training large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.",

      "title": "Dynamic Personality Adaptation in Large Language Models via State Machines",
      "summary": "The inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to modulate their personality expression in response to evolving dialogue dynamics hinders their performance in complex, interactive contexts. We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.",

      "title": "Provable Last-Iterate Convergence for Multi-Objective Safe LLM Alignment via Optimistic Primal-Dual",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.",

      "title": "When AI Writes, Whose Voice Remains? Quantifying Cultural Marker Erasure Across World English Varieties in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to ``professionalize'' workplace communication, often at the cost of linguistic identity. We introduce \"Cultural Ghosting\", the systematic erasure of linguistic markers unique to non-native English varieties during text processing. Through analysis of 22,350 LLM outputs generated from 1,490 culturally marked texts (Indian, Singaporean,& Nigerian English) processed by five models under three prompt conditions, we quantify this phenomenon using two novel metrics: Identity Erasure Rate (IER) & Semantic Preservation Score (SPS). Across all prompts, we find an overall IER of 10.26%, with model-level variation from 3.5% to 20.5% (5.9x range). Crucially, we identify a Semantic Preservation Paradox: models maintain high semantic similarity (mean SPS = 0.748) while systematically erasing cultural markers. Pragmatic markers (politeness conventions) are 1.9x more vulnerable than lexical markers (71.5% vs. 37.1% erasure). Our experiments demonstrate that explicit cultural-preservation prompts reduce erasure by 29% without sacrificing semantic quality.",

      "title": "WeaveTime: Stream from Earlier Frames into Emergent Memory in VideoLLMs",
      "summary": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

      "summary": "Instruction-following benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, leaving a critical evaluation gap for the hundreds of millions of Indic language speakers. We introduce IndicIFEval, a benchmark evaluating constrained generation of LLMs across 14 Indic languages using automatically verifiable, rule-based instructions. It comprises around 800 human-verified examples per language spread across two complementary subsets: IndicIFEval-Ground, translated prompts from IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) carefully localized for Indic contexts, and IndicIFEval-Ground, synthetically generated instructions grounded in native Indic content. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of major open-weight and proprietary models spanning both reasoning and non-reasoning models. While models maintain strong adherence to formatting constraints, they struggle significantly with lexical and cross-lingual tasks -- and despite progress in high-resource languages, instruction-following across the broader Indic family lags significantly behind English. We release IndicIFEval and its evaluation scripts to support progress on multilingual constrained generation (http://github.com/ai4bharat/IndicIFEval).",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized inference across diverse natural language tasks, with larger models performing better but at higher computational costs. We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\\% to 40\\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\\%, further improving cost efficiency. These findings indicate the potential of confidence-based model selection to enhance real-world LLM deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as edge devices and commercial API applications.",

From a formative study with basketball players and coaches, the system addresses three challenges: understanding skills, identifying errors, and correcting mistakes. ViSTAR follows the Behavioral Skills Training (BST) framework-instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback. It provides feedback through visual overlays, rhythm and timing cues, and an AI-powered coaching agent using 3D motion reconstruction. We generate verbal feedback by analyzing spatio-temporal joint data and mapping features to natural-language coaching cues via a Large Language Model (LLM). A key novelty is this feedback generation: motion features become concise coaching insights. In two studies (N=16), participants generally preferred our AI-generated feedback to coach feedback and reported that ViSTAR helped them notice posture and balance issues and refine movements beyond self-observation.",

Contributing to the debate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine ToM capabilities, our study investigates their ToM robustness using perturbations on false-belief tasks and examines the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) to enhance performance and explain the LLM's decision. We introduce a handcrafted, richly annotated ToM dataset, including classic and perturbed false belief tasks, the corresponding spaces of valid reasoning chains for correct task completion, subsequent reasoning faithfulness, task solutions, and propose metrics to evaluate reasoning chain correctness and to what extent final answers are faithful to reasoning traces of the generated CoT. We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present. While CoT prompting improves the ToM performance overall in a faithful manner, it surprisingly degrades accuracy for some perturbation classes, indicating that selective application is necessary.",

      "title": "Language Models Exhibit Inconsistent Biases Towards Algorithmic Agents and Human Experts",
      "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.",

      "title": "Semantic Partial Grounding via LLMs",
      "summary": "Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.",

      "title": "IOAgent: Democratizing Trustworthy HPC I/O Performance Diagnosis Capability via LLMs",
      "summary": "As the complexity of the HPC storage stack rapidly grows, domain scientists face increasing challenges in effectively utilizing HPC storage systems to achieve their desired I/O performance. To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.",

In this article, we provide an overview of the impact that foundation models and transformer networks have had on these different levels, bringing robots closer than ever to \"full-stack transfer\". Considering LLMs, VLMs and VLAs from a robotic transfer learning perspective allows us to highlight recurring concepts for transfer, beyond specific implementations. We also consider the challenges of data collection and transfer benchmarks for robotics in the age of foundation models. Are foundation models the route to full-stack transfer in robotics?

      "summary": "Automated test generation is essential for software quality assurance, with coverage rate serving as a key metric to ensure thorough testing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods.",

Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.",

However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.",

Closing this gap matters for practitioners who rely on LLMs to guide algorithm selection and deployment. We address this limitation using causal discovery as a testbed and evaluate eight frontier LLMs against ground truth derived from large-scale algorithm executions and find systematic, near-total failure. Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning. We term this failure algorithmic blindness and argue it reflects a fundamental gap between declarative knowledge about algorithms and calibrated procedural prediction.",
