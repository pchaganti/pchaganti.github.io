      "title": "Unbiased Gradient Low-Rank Projection",
      "summary": "Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large\nlanguage models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank\nprojection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a\nrepresentative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is\ntheir lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches\nintroduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,\nwhich contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.\nAiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling\ntechnique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an\ninstantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank\noptimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named\nGaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the\nconvergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory\nefficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and\npretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even\nbetter performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows\nthat the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution\nof knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model\nparameter space and better memorization.",

      "title": "Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for\ntasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.\nHowever, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive\ncomputational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.\nIn this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle\nthis challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a\nframework that renders long texts into images and processes them with\nvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.",

Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

      "summary": "Tuning database management systems (DBMSs) is challenging due to trillions of\npossible configurations and evolving workloads. Recent advances in tuning have\nled to breakthroughs in optimizing over the possible configurations. However,\ndue to their design and inability to leverage query-level historical insights,\nexisting automated tuners struggle to adapt and re-optimize the DBMS when the\nenvironment changes (e.g., workload drift, schema transfer).\n  This paper presents the Booster framework that assists existing tuners in\nadapting to environment changes (e.g., drift, cross-schema transfer). Booster\nstructures historical artifacts into query-configuration contexts, prompts\nlarge language models (LLMs) to suggest configurations for each query based on\nrelevant contexts, and then composes the query-level suggestions into a\nholistic configuration with beam search. With multiple OLAP workloads, we\nevaluate Booster's ability to assist different state-of-the-art tuners (e.g.,\ncost-/machine learning-/LLM-based) in adapting to environment changes. By\ncomposing recommendations derived from query-level insights, Booster assists\ntuners in discovering configurations that are up to 74% better and in up to\n4.7x less time than the alternative approach of continuing to tune from\nhistorical configurations.",

However, for applications that need operating with constraints\non specific metrics (e.g., precision $\\geq$ 95%), decision making with\nblack-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output\ncardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,\npreventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this\npaper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently\nimproving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,\nwe first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs\nand show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative\nverbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,\nuncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that\nthey do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing\nperformance or increasing inference cost.

While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have\nmade progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do\nnot effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight\nfew-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key\ninnovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output\nformat that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large\ncontext window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic\ndata augmentation technique that preserves entity information while\nparaphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data\nwithout compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nshow that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models\non few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an\naverage F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets.

However, their scalability\nis limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging\ncoding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only\nthousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation\nmethods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting\nchallenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,\na novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and\ndifficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized\ngenerators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators\ndemonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging\nproblems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate\nlarge-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong\nteacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning\nfor smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation\nexperiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after\nfine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we\nsurpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an\nadditional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple\nsynthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger\nDeepSeek-R1-671B.
