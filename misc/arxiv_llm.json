      "title": "SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars",
      "summary": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural\nlanguage understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.\nInspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework\nthat extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar\nspectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical\ninformation about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively\ntrained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance\nprecision stellar spectroscopy.",

      "title": "The Thin Line Between Comprehension and Persuasion in LLMs",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,\nconvincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators\nin sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings\ntie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand\nthe context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,\nif an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to\nknow what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and\ncoherence are secondary to effectiveness.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile\nrobots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent\noperation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face\nchallenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to\nconcerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT\napplications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control\nframework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback\nand refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator.\nOur framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into\nnatural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's\nunderstanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework\nalso enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the\nrisks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the\nrefinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different\ncomplexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework\ncan achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms\nbaseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase\nof task complexity.",

Using market digest texts--including objective morning\nsummaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess\ndecision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human\ninvestors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our\nfindings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random\nperformance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical\ncommentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual\nhuman or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance\nof evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic\ndecision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of\ntraditional intrinsic metrics.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful\ntechnique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nHowever, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a\nsignificant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this\nissue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We\nintroduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning\nparadigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse\npreference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each\nobjective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the\ntrade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which\nincorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto\nsolutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for\nmultiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both\nhelpfulness and harmlessness.",

      "title": "High-Layer Attention Pruning with Rescaling",
      "summary": "Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models\n(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional\ntraining-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that\nindiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,\nwithout considering their positions within the network architecture. In this\nwork, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention\nheads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can\nalter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive\nrescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to\ncounteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of\nLLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our\nevaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable\nin generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing\nbaselines.",

However, their substantial\nmodel size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread\ndeployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form\nCoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the\n\"SLMs Learnability Gap\". To address this, we introduce\n\\textbf{Mi}d-\\textbf{Co}T \\textbf{T}eacher \\textbf{A}ssistant Distillation\n(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA\nemploys intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes\nintermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning\nlength gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs\ndistilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they\nachieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and\n3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and\nGSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform\na quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more\nclosely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for\nfuture research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.",

Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these\nworkflows by providing explicit \"Submit\" (commit data) and \"Reset\" (discard\ndata) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously.

This paper proposes modeling these\nGUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching\n(reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By\ncapturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT)\nreasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user\nconfusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic.\nWe demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios,\nhighlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and\nefficiency.",

      "summary": "Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human\nintervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and\nmaintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study\ndemonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with\nparticular advantages in addressing complex bugs.",

However, the quantization process in AR-based\nvisual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades\nimage fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to\nautoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside\nin a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an\nunbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging\nand increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on\nthe above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned\nContinuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete\ntokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the\nconditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete\ntokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token\nmodeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization.

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata.
