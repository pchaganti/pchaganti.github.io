      "title": "Pangu Light: Weight Re-Initialization for Pruning and Accelerating LLMs",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across\nnumerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant\ncomputational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning\noffers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often\nstruggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and\ndepth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper\nargues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive\njoint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of\nremaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We\nintroduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around\nstructured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques\ndesigned to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically\ntargets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and\nRMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like\nCross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)\nthat mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training\nstarting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates\nspecialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and\ntailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models\nconsistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming\nprominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like\nQwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average\nscore and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and\n2225 tokens/s.",

      "title": "UORA: Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation in\n  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Models",
      "summary": "This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA),\na novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language\nModels (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter\nefficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number\nof trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA\nemploys an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively\nreinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the\nvector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable\nparameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage\nefficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate\nUORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with\nnegligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and\nE2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language\nmodels and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new\nparadigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.",

      "title": "FUDOKI: Discrete Flow-based Unified Understanding and Generation via\n  Kinetic-Optimal Velocities",
      "summary": "The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the\nemergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual\nunderstanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most\nexisting MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent\nlimitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image\ngeneration and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In\nthis work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing\nFUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as\nan alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced\nprobability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond\nthe previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement\nwith self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration\nduring generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we\ninitialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to\nthe discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI\nachieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both\nvisual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as\na foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we\nshow that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant\nperformance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement\nthrough reinforcement learning.",

We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nLLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and\nrenderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks,\nStructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats\nthrough two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from\nnatural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between\nstructured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task,\nwith novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness.

      "title": "Iterative Self-Incentivization Empowers Large Language Models as Agentic\n  Searchers",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information\nretrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs\nto seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the\ncomplexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To\naddress these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,\nwhere the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds\nthrough a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to\nretrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts\nfine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM\nwith this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and\nassigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a\nre-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM\niteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself\nfor search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,\nestablishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms\nbaselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these\npromising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our\nmethod to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.",

A wide range of\nframeworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.\nThese frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language\nprompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various\nagents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for\nany given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and\nobservability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal\ndiscovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing\ndeveloper observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the\nemergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with\nLLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and\nunintended behavioral variability.

We propose\nTrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to\nembed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic\nsteganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We\nintroduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to\nevaluate the risk profile of the threat.

Overall, there is an\nurgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of\nhistorical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary\nstructure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has\nrevolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications\nfor Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this,\nno thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries\nto fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction\nbased on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's\nZibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary\nworks.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a\nwide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their\nconsiderable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring\nthe importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling\nefficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM\ncompression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy.\nHowever, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation,\nresulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers\nof the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression\nmethod. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the\ntruncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall\ncompression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,\nwhich mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of\ncompressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families\nand multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its\npractical effectiveness.",

      "summary": "We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully\nopen-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of\ntraditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and\nrelationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability\nto real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,\nour approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships\n(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture\nfeaturing a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality\nvisual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder\nfor end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of\ncomplex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy\nthat synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.\nSpecifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,\nand multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with\nminimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of\ncatastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a\nvisual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation\nstrategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during\nfine-tuning.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling\ncomplex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning\nsteps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing\nchallenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing\nreasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning\nprocesses through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,\nsupervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement\nlearning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce\nreasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More\nrecent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain\nreasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control\nto toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach\nthat autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on\nproblem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base\nmodel to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then\nemploy reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation\nwhile maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating\nreinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to\nassess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,\nimplementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the\nmodel's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning\ntype.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can\ndynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without\nsubstantially sacrificing performance.

However, they often suffer from heavy computational\noverhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video\nframes. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention\nscores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent\nbiases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual\ntoken sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same\nspatial positions across different frames.
