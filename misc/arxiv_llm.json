      "summary": "As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and\nmore complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their\nconversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users\nbetter manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal\nalignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results\nwith examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to\nnavigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20\nparticipants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat\ninterface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance.",

      "summary": "According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average\nAmerican spends $\\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the\nU.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of\noverlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly\npenalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,\nmaking modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We\npropose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate\ntax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging\nStAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for\nestimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties\nfor tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of\nplain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently\nretrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve\nperformance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.\nOur results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic\narchitectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.",

      "summary": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in\nhigh computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose\nCogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages\ninstruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and\nperformance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and\nintroduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based\nAggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the\nvision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,\nforming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this\ncompact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)\nintroduces action intent into the language model by pruning\ninstruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level\nsparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support\naccurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention\n(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional\naction parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and\nreal-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing\ntraining costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold\ncompared to OpenVLA.

      "summary": "Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their\nexcessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for\nreal-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving\nsuperior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.\nHowever, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave\nnormally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended\noutput when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either\nlack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only\nmechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like\nmodel-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we\npresent LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through\nknowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,\nLETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then\nmerged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting\nthe backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE\nincorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to\ndistract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on\nclassification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate\nthat LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor\nattacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by\nup to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be\ncost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.",

Existing diagnosability\nsupports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify\nconfiguration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the\nsoftware clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the\nblank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging\npractices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that\nunifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation\nto enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)\nidentifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing\nconfiguration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates\ndiagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation\nresults on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of\nConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,\nConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration\ndiagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent\nmisconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit\nconfiguration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%\ncoverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers\nby 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,\nand 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of\nvariable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user\nstudy on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by\n1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.",

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong\nbalance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we\nfine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it\nto select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally\naligned.
