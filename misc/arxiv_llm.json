      "title": "Reasoning in Space via Grounding in the World",
      "summary": "In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of\nspatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to\nexplore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.\nExisting 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable\nof jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is\nmanifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance\non external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding\nand spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective\ndual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both\nsemantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D\nrepresentation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing\nthe number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,\nGS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely\nwithout external modules while delivering performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework\nfor 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we\nintroduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is\nmeticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects\nreferenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that\nintegrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results\non 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial\nreasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.",

      "title": "The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language\nmodels (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable\nto those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,\nthere is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic\nimprovements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale\nsystematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a\nprincipled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit\nsigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of\ncommon design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and\ncompute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic\nperformance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,\nand off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without\nmaterially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow\npredictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale\nruns. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation\nperformance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work\nprovides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a\npractical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long\nachieved in pre-training.",

Confidence estimation is especially critical in\nhigh-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an\nincorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach\nextends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward\nnetwork (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information\nloss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax\nnormalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification\ntask, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness\nagainst noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry\ncustomer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms\nstrong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.\nExperiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the\n16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results\ndemonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,\narchitecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for\nsequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical\nlimitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to\ninference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods\ntypically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent\ninteractions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals.\nSecond, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single\npredicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and\nlimiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose\nHyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which\nleverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from\nlong user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest\nembeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a\nresidual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression\nand reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of\nusers, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages\nmultiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals\nadaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected\nindustrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

      "title": "From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI\n  Guardrails",
      "summary": "Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end\nusers in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to\nnext-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about\nblocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like\nfinancial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output\nclassification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making\nthem brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are\nflagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system\nsimply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving\nand e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can\nreliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to\nbankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic\nalternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.",

      "summary": "Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements\nof Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model\nto recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the\nper-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full\nretraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,\nfinding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it\nto optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics\nthat ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we\ninstead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and\nsolve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method\ndrastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines\non state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide\ntheoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence\nguarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the\noriginal combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to\nintegrality.",

However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via\nmimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often\nencourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the\nhuman attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly\nexplicit human feedback to provide a training signal.

Our\nempowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,\nproviding a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better\nassist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person\nuser study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.\nParticipants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%\nhigher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions.

      "summary": "Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in\naligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward\nover-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to\nits mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward\nmodels overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of\nsuitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level\nconstraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we\npropose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant\ninformation to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that\nreward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent\nspace, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.\nMotivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that\npenalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape\nwhile maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to\nthe pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present\nMahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying\nreward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online\nmitigation such as early stopping.

We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:\nthe performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs\nrelative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.\nRecent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech\nsynthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic\ndata, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not\nreproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient\nalternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap.

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading.

      "title": "RAG Meets Temporal Graphs: Time-Sensitive Modeling and Retrieval for\n  Evolving Knowledge",
      "summary": "Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time.\nAlthough current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with\nexternal knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two\nchallenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware\nrepresentations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with\nvector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG\nevaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs\nand retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we\npropose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level\ntemporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped\nrelations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries\nare generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends\nat that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new\ntemporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing\ngraph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different\ntimes as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows\nonly generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring\neffective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves\na subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling\nprecise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive\nquestion-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along\nwith a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update\ncapabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG\nsignificantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.",
