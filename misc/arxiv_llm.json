      "title": "From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User\n  Profiling",
      "summary": "Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks\nlike misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring,\nand user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including\ntweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation\nlearning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability,\nproduce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on\nrigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements,\nwhich serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain\nas foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs\nsemi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates\nboth abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative\ntweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with\nminimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while\nreducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates\ninterpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data\ninto a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for\ndownstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X)\ndataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.\nExperimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nLLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in\ncreating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.",

      "title": "A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle\n  Routing Problem with Time Windows",
      "summary": "The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a\nclassic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics\ndistribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the\nconstraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant\nchallenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)\nprovide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This\npaper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW\nwith real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive\ntwo-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration\nphase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability,\nwe design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical\nconstraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the\nexperience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the\narchitecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a\n7.3\\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer\ntraining steps required for convergence.",

      "title": "MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs' Image Retouching Skills",
      "summary": "Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.\nGenerative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible\nto users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in\nunacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional\nprocedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,\nLightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.\nUnfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual\nprocedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In\nthis paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to\ncritique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them\nwith a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate\nthat MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing\noperations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.\nSubsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit\nsequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we\nsynthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits\nand then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize\nreasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by\nconstruction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and\nresolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a\nvariety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and\nidentity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural\nalternatives.

      "summary": "This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired\nby large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel\nequalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The\nproposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from\na prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of\nprompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder\noutput as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol\nestimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants,\nbased on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and\nevaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear\nassumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization,\nICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even\nwhen the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results\nalso highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training\ndiversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in\nresource-constrained scenarios.",

Multilingual\ninstruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ\noffer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in\nidentifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains\nunderexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight\nnon-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing\nthem to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world\nevaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for\nhate speech detection.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs\nhave the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify\nthe task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they\nneed through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM\nconversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in\nuser instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,\nfully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale\nsimulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn\nsettings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs\nwe test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations\nthan single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.\nAnalysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance\ndegradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant\nincrease in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early\nturns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly\nrely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a\nconversation, they get lost and do not recover*.",

However, current methods generally suffer\nfrom several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the\ngeneralization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of\ntask-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic\norder information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing\ncross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal\ninformation. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient\ndual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make\nfull use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design\na task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most\ndiscriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction.\nFurthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed\nsequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce\nsemantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the\nsequential relationships between these sub-actions.
