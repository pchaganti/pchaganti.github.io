      "title": "Can LLMs Lie? Investigation beyond Hallucination",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across\na variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications\nraises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional\nfalsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM\nknowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior\nof LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical\nscenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the\nneural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal\ninterventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control\ndeceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce\nbehavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying\ntendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task\nperformance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal\noptimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,\nshedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in\nhigh-stakes environments.

      "title": "Strefer: Empowering Video LLMs with Space-Time Referring and Reasoning\n  via Synthetic Instruction Data",
      "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.",

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for\nexternal components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer\nduring inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for\nhigh-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)\nobjective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we\npioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language\nModel (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based\nmethods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

      "title": "On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms",
      "summary": "For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their\neffectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks.",

      "title": "The Impact of Critique on LLM-Based Model Generation from Natural\n  Language: The Case of Activity Diagrams",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the\ngeneration of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is\nan iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are\nproduced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs\nto address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules\n- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in\nthe source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a\npipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process\ndescriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in\nLADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment\nchecks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX\nto study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of\nLLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of\nalgorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.\n  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with\nexpert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This\nenables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on\ntwo datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural\nvalidity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)\nalgorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks\nfail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness\nby 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks\nwith LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4\nMini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of\nup to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer\nthan five LLM calls on average.",

      "summary": "This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the\ngap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the\nphysical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency.",

The paradigm\nof LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily\nfocuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where\nmulti-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are\ncritical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a\nchallenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary\nInformation Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6\npreviously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios.

We\nintroduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in\ninstruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question\nmethodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific\nexpressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social\ncategories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin.

To our knowledge, our work\npresents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs\nrespond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying\npatterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also\ncontribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do\nnot effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain\nlargely consistent across different sampling temperatures.
