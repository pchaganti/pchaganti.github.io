      "summary": "CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in\nreal-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end\nautomation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle\ninteractive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.\nTo address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based\nbenchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning\nand interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic\nCAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225\nCAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,\nwhich quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each\npuzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect\nscores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates\nat most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,\n93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing\nthe limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more\nrobust multimodal reasoning systems.

      "title": "MoDoMoDo: Multi-Domain Data Mixtures for Multimodal LLM Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.\nApplying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but\nis complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks\nthat demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,\ntraining MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates\nchallenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,\nhighlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve\ngeneralization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework\nfor Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation\nand benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR\nframework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains\ndifferent verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online\nRL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture\nstrategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data\nmixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.\nComprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when\ncombined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM\ngeneral reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained\nmodel's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%\ncompared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a\ntotal of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.",

      "title": "SiLVR: A Simple Language-based Video Reasoning Framework",
      "summary": "Recent advances in test-time optimization have led to remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve highly\ncomplex problems in math and coding. However, the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex\nvideo-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SiLVR, a Simple\nLanguage-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video\nunderstanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video\ninto language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short\nclip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language\ndescriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex\nvideo-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs,\nwe use an adaptive token reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the\ntemporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and\ntraining-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on\nVideo-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.\nFurthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows\nthat, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can\neffectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and\naudio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition\nreasoning tasks in video.

      "summary": "A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty\ncommunication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false\nclaims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first\nsystematic study of $\\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,\nbenchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that\n$\\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a\ncomprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results\ndemonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing\ninterventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only\nmarginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even\nharm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce\nMetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human\nmetacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration\nacross diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in\nfaithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged\nby humans.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced\nreasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer\ncomplex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However,\nstandard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning\nexamples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the\ncritical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning\ntraces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an\noffline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a\ntwo-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and\nnegative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a\nsimple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like\nDPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT\ncombined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the\nQwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples\nfrom the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).\nIts performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a\nmodel post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models\npost-trained offline with openly available data.",

      "summary": "Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when\napplying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry\n(BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently\ndiverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification\nlimits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.\nTheoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture\ndistribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.\nWhile existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained\nannotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by\npredefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.\nIn this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances\npersonalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference\ndatasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first\nstage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture\ndiverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online\nrouting strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific\ncontext to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference\nadaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple\npreference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human\npreferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.",

      "summary": "Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable\nlanguage models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread\ndeployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This\npaper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection\nof biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject\nsubtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which\npropagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose\ntwo propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple\ntasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining\nnormal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning\nrate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted\nscenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation,\nadversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen\ntasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements,\nphishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various\ndistillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code\ngeneration. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses -\nperplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater\nframeworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security\nvulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized\nsafeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective\nadversarial bias mitigation strategies.",

      "summary": "This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)\nlack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even\nwell-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck\nfor vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone\nFish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million\nfour-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six\ntaxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM\nusing our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because\nthe VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision\nLLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual\nconcepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy\nknowledge.",

In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt at\nengineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD\nis a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video\nrecordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for\ncollecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared\nto existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity\nin UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x\nlonger time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream\napplications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision\n3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nevaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video\nunderstanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose\nVideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly\nfrom video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines. Both\nVideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key\nchallenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the\nneed for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and\nlong-horizon dependencies.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are\nprone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to\ntheir clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as\nRetrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding\nanswers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level\nexplainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking\nframework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used\nin medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated\nresponses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is\nindependently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical\nguidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct\ntracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and\nexplainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader\nassessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated\nsignificant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework\nachieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination\ndetection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant\nchunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the\ngenerated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.\nThis work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable\nclinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical\napplication and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.",

To address this gap, we propose three steps: First,\nwe develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on\nclarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of\nlegal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.\n  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off\nat 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\\%$ noted at\n72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and\ncontext length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical\nsignificance thresholds above 0.016.

      "title": "Drop Dropout on Single-Epoch Language Model Pretraining",
      "summary": "Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that\nreduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep\nlearning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to\nmodern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for\nlarge LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on\nthe role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch\npretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs\nwith varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language\nmodeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and\nnatural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during\npretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced \"early dropout\"\nalso degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further\ninvestigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without\ndropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and\nequivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate\nto drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.",

Humans typically express\nconfidence through epistemic markers (e.g., \"fairly confident\") instead of\nnumerical values.

However, real-world\ndeployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication\ndemands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and\nsystem resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the\nglobal model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and\nfurther degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods\nleverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to\nreduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to\nsimultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low\nsystem costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated\nfine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific\nupdates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates\ndiagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and\nemploys rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen\ngeneralization under data heterogeneity.
