      "title": "DyTopo: Dynamic Topology Routing for Multi-Agent Reasoning via Semantic Matching",
      "summary": "Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \\key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.",

      "title": "CommCP: Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via LLM-Based Communication with Conformal Prediction",
      "summary": "To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines. The experiment videos, code, and dataset are available on our project website: https://comm-cp.github.io.",

      "title": "DFlash: Block Diffusion for Flash Speculative Decoding",
      "summary": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.",

      "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

      "summary": "Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \\textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \\textsc{Low}/\\textsc{Mid}/\\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\\% accuracy improvements and 49\\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.",

We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare.

      "title": "DSB: Dynamic Sliding Block Scheduling for Diffusion LLMs",
      "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.",

      "title": "Layer-wise LoRA fine-tuning: a similarity metric approach",
      "summary": "Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Our vision is that LLM agents should resemble remote human collaborators, which allows HCI researchers to ground the future exploration in decades of research on trust, awareness, and common ground in remote human collaboration, while also revealing the unique opportunities and challenges that emerge when one or more partners are AI agents. This workshop establishes a foundational research agenda for the new era by posing the question: How can the rich understanding of remote human collaboration inspire and inform the design and study of human-agent collaboration? We will bring together an interdisciplinary group from HCI, CSCW, and AI to explore this critical transition. The 180-minute workshop will be highly interactive, featuring a keynote speaker, a series of invited lightning talks, and an exploratory group design session where participants will storyboard novel paradigms of human-agent partnership.

Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.",

In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment.

      "summary": "High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.",

      "summary": "Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.",

      "summary": "Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.",

      "summary": "Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in academic writing workflows, yet they frequently hallucinate by generating citations to sources that do not exist. This study analyzes 100 AI-generated hallucinated citations that appeared in papers accepted by the 2025 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the world's most prestigious AI conferences. Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance). These findings demonstrate that current peer review processes do not include effective citation verification and that the problem extends beyond NeurIPS to other major conferences, government reports, and professional consulting.

We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.",
