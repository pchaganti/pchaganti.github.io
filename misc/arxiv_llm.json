      "title": "The Staircase of Ethics: Probing LLM Value Priorities through Multi-Step\n  Induction to Complex Moral Dilemmas",
      "summary": "Ethical decision-making is a critical aspect of human judgment, and the\ngrowing use of LLMs in decision-support systems necessitates a rigorous\nevaluation of their moral reasoning capabilities. However, existing assessments\nprimarily rely on single-step evaluations, failing to capture how models adapt\nto evolving ethical challenges. Addressing this gap, we introduce the\nMulti-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), the first dataset specifically constructed to\nevaluate the evolving moral judgments of LLMs across 3,302 five-stage dilemmas.\nThis framework enables a fine-grained, dynamic analysis of how LLMs adjust\ntheir moral reasoning across escalating dilemmas. Our evaluation of nine widely\nused LLMs reveals that their value preferences shift significantly as dilemmas\nprogress, indicating that models recalibrate moral judgments based on scenario\ncomplexity. Furthermore, pairwise value comparisons demonstrate that while LLMs\noften prioritize the value of care, this value can sometimes be superseded by\nfairness in certain contexts, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent\nnature of LLM ethical reasoning. Our findings call for a shift toward dynamic,\ncontext-aware evaluation paradigms, paving the way for more human-aligned and\nvalue-sensitive development of LLMs.",

      "title": "Fann or Flop: A Multigenre, Multiera Benchmark for Arabic Poetry\n  Understanding in LLMs",
      "summary": "Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded\nforms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings,\nstylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language\nmodels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks,\ntheir ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this\nwork, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the\ncomprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21\ncore poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures\nto contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems\nwith explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation,\nprosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension\noffers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding\nclassical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this\ndomain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic\nunderstanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release\n`Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to\nenable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with\nneedle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information (\"the needle\") must be\ndrawn from a large pool of irrelevant context (\"the haystack\"). Previous\nstudies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical\nfactors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has\nreceived little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how\nvariations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context\nquestion answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops\nsharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts\nconsistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,\nposing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,\nfine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three\ndiverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical\nreasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.\nOur work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware\nLLM-driven systems.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools,\nthanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their\nabilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text\ndescriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is\nsurprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent\ntool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool\ndescriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs\nwhen competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that\ntools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from\nGPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further\nevaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly\nwith one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set\nof 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful\nway to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation\nfor agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.",

      "summary": "We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by\nLLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied\nverbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of\ncontrollable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt,\nintegrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To\ngenerate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting\nand combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while\nmaintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts\nalong three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability.\nGemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts\nare coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these\noutputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing\nlimitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify\nFrankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between\nsegments, especially in longer generations.

But, it remains challenging\nin multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations.\nExisting methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns,\ngenerating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas.\nTo address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that\ndecouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the\nfirst stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a\nsingle-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This\nallows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted\nby the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is\ngenerated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by\nreconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and\nBIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art\nbaselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data\naccess or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.",

However, current LLM-based\nGUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the\ndifficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works\nhave been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to\noffer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model\n(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can\nover-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,\nwe propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative\nintermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in\nonline training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,\nwe further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)\nself-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign\nprogress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and\nanalyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and\nORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\nunderstanding and generating semantic patterns, making them promising\ncandidates for sequential recommendation tasks. However, when combined with\nconventional recommendation models (CRMs), LLMs often face challenges related\nto high inference costs and static knowledge transfer methods. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters\ndynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based\nrecommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods,\nLLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models,\nenhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with\ncollaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise\nadaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates\nthe need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec\nsignificantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks\nwithout increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and\nefficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in\nsequential recommendation systems.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of\nLLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier\nsignals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such\nverification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference\nanswers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the\nprevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose\nNegative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to\nreflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers.\nIn online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers,\nNFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy\nis parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive\ndata, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct\nexperiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently\nshow that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT\nsignificantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning,\nmatching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in\nstrict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different\ntheoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the\ngap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.",

      "summary": "Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant\nconversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the\nmost widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs,\nconverting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most\nare constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different\ngroups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on\npaid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert\nimage metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and\nmakes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new\ndatasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and\nunified recipe and approach,~\\textbf{\\method}, for converting available\nmetadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \\method\nfeatures an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data\nand prompt organization, and conversation sampling.

      "title": "How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?",
      "summary": "Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks\ncontaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or\nintentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep\nthe benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions\nto the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single\norganization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.\nTo overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without\ncompletely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still\nmaintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject\nrandomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and\nonly include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the\nbest possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is\nthis helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach\nalso offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully\ncapable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this\nceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data\ncontamination.

In particular, multi-turn\nRL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated\nwhen training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the\nAPIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to\nimprove the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather\nthan RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses\ngoal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that\nscales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task\nwill unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple\npossible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most\ndata come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality\nsources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when\ntraining LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense\ndatasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data\n(arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit\nphase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through\ncontrolled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped\ndata, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical\nvalue, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the\nbiographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost\nnothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly\nmemorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity\nallocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack\nproblem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation\nacross datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio\nvaries. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and\nreveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing\nratio following a power-law relationship with the model size.

      "summary": "The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1\noutcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate\nreasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe\noverthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward\nfunctions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct\ncompletions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward\nfunctions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length\ndecreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in\ntraining. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution\nGRPO-$\\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically\nadjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among\ncompletions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates\nthe need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a\nswitch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A\nhigh ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results\nshow that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty\nwhile maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to\nanalyze how the generalization error of the PRM affects compute efficiency and\nreasoning performance. Leveraging PAC-Bayes theory, we derive generalization\nbounds and show that a lower generalization error of PRM leads to fewer samples\nrequired to find correct answers. Motivated by this analysis, we propose\nCompute-Aware Tree Search (CATS), an actor-critic framework that dynamically\ncontrols search behavior. The actor outputs sampling hyperparameters based on\nreward distributions and sparsity statistics, while the critic estimates their\nutility to guide budget allocation. Experiments on the MATH and AIME benchmarks\nwith various LLMs and PRMs demonstrate that CATS consistently outperforms other\nexternal TTS methods, validating our theoretical predictions.",
