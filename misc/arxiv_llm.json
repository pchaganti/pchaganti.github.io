      "summary": "Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation\nwith clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.\nWe systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public\nmammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,\nabnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently\nwas the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and\ndomain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores\namong GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),\ncalcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it\nattained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%\nmalignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection\nand 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS\naccuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared\nwith human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and\nspecificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening\ntasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging\napplications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the\ntremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising\ntrend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with\nmammography VQA tasks.",

      "title": "Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding",
      "summary": "As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it\nis becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In\nthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To\nachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs\nand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method\ninvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide\nthe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to\nindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's\noutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference\nprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of\neach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off\nobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving\ncontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to\ncontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of\nvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination\nbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM\ninference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation\nmethods.",

      "title": "Aware First, Think Less: Dynamic Boundary Self-Awareness Drives Extreme\n  Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved\ntheir capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,\nimpairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time\napplications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on\nhuman-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared\ndifficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic\nReasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to\ndynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem\ncomplexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness\nAlignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.\nThese components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing\nefficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response\ntokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain\nin token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited\nto resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass\ntraditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%\naccuracy improvement.",

      "summary": "Copyright protection for large language models is of critical importance,\ngiven their substantial development costs, proprietary value, and potential for\nmisuse. Existing surveys have predominantly focused on techniques for tracing\nLLM-generated content-namely, text watermarking-while a systematic exploration\nof methods for protecting the models themselves (i.e., model watermarking and\nmodel fingerprinting) remains absent. Moreover, the relationships and\ndistinctions among text watermarking, model watermarking, and model\nfingerprinting have not been comprehensively clarified. This work presents a\ncomprehensive survey of the current state of LLM copyright protection\ntechnologies, with a focus on model fingerprinting, covering the following\naspects: (1) clarifying the conceptual connection from text watermarking to\nmodel watermarking and fingerprinting, and adopting a unified terminology that\nincorporates model watermarking into the broader fingerprinting framework; (2)\nproviding an overview and comparison of diverse text watermarking techniques,\nhighlighting cases where such methods can function as model fingerprinting; (3)\nsystematically categorizing and comparing existing model fingerprinting\napproaches for LLM copyright protection; (4) presenting, for the first time,\ntechniques for fingerprint transfer and fingerprint removal; (5) summarizing\nevaluation metrics for model fingerprints, including effectiveness,\nharmlessness, robustness, stealthiness, and reliability; and (6) discussing\nopen challenges and future research directions.

As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we\ninvestigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural\nmetrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,\ntargeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency\nacross input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region\nresponds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)\nusing an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both\nlanguage-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more\nmeaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly\nsensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally\nrepresent cross-modal conceptual meaning.",

      "title": "Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large\n  Language Models",
      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to\nexamine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment\nframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for\nreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes\nin AI systems and the societies they influence.",

      "summary": "Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central\nchallenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion\ncaused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the\neffectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful\nactions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely\noverlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid\nplans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with\nproblem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into\nmultiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize\nLLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where\nLLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and\nLLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.\nWe empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple\ndomains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving\nlarge-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs.",

      "summary": "Automatic code translation is a fundamental task in modern software\ndevelopment. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly\nimproved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of\nexecution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce\nTRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution\nefficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven\ntwo-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to\namplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task\npruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting\nbenchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python,\neach accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10\ncomputationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative\nLLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient\ncode translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for\ncorrectness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account,\nsurpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that\nalgorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental,\ncausing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\\times$ and memory increase of\n12.0$\\times$, respectively.

While most NLP studies classify sentiment from\nreview text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and\nexpectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are\nshaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference\npoints. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such\nsupplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare\nnatural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B\nparameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on\ntwo Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with\nadditional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1\nrises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it\ndeployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up\nanalysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning\nrather than label proxying.

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)\nand leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the\ndevelopment of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced\ngeneral-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in\nreal-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion\nArena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected\ndirectly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model\ncomparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect\npractical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation.

Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the\nsexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,\nanti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on\nhigh-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year\n2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech\nas harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical\nstyles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who\nchallenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.\nWe argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful\nschemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and\nexplicitly include counter-speech in training data.

Existing approaches that\nintegrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model\npatterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable\nHarmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic\nWeighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically\nweighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process.

Current\napproaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce,\nhighly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire.\nThese methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack\nmulti-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with\nexpert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the\nfirst LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1\ndiagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with\nspecific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step\ndisorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This\nworkflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring\nadherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we\nevaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism,\ndiagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are\nfully open-sourced.",
