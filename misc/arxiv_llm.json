      "title": "Outbidding and Outbluffing Elite Humans: Mastering Liar's Poker via\n  Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for\nenvironments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and\nreasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite\nhuman play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:\nmost hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple\nrounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players.",

      "summary": "Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing\ncommon ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while\nreferring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme\nfor the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures\nspeaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,\nenabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over\ntime. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings\nare rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies\nsystematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask\nreferential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an\nanalytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating\n(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative\ndialogue.",

      "summary": "Air quality monitoring is central to environmental sustainability and public\nhealth, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-expert users to\ninterpret due to complex visualizations, limited interactivity, and high\ndeployment costs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to\nproduce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To\naddress these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface\n(AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live\nenvironmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing\nhallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a\nresponsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system\nfunctions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator\nrather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual\naccuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a\nscale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results\nhighlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to\ncreate reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time\nenvironmental monitoring.",

      "summary": "In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit\nconspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this\ndomain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial\nperspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the\npsychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social\nscience and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.",

      "summary": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the\nphysical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.",

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis.

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack\nthat infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet\nsize and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with\nproviders to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the\nneed for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle\nincreasingly sensitive information.",

      "summary": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

      "title": "Towards Transparent Stance Detection: A Zero-Shot Approach Using\n  Implicit and Explicit Interpretability",
      "summary": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.
