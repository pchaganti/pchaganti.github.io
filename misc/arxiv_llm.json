      "title": "LOST: Low-rank and Sparse Pre-training for Large Language Models",
      "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance\nacross a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive\ncomputational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies\nhave investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing\nmodel size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a\ncomplementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank\ncompression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,\nexisting approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a\nsimplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance\ndegradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{LO}w-rank and \\textbf{S}parse pre-\\textbf{T}raining (\\textbf{LOST}) for\nLLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures\nto enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency\nconstraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,\npreserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining\nsingular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the\nexpressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining\nranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while\nsignificantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is\navailable at\n\\href{https://github.com/JiaxiLi1/LOST-Low-rank-and-Sparse-Training-for-Large-Language-Models}{LOST\nRepo}",

      "summary": "Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a\nsemi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the\nstate-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.\nHowever, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets\nthemselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in\neven fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent\nmultilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying\nseveral errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across\nseveral LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and\nidentify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based\non these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable\nand should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We\nend with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as\nconsumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.",

      "summary": "This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel\ncognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with\ngenerative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal\nexchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under\ncertain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even\ninteriority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,\nbut in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological\ncomplexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the\nphenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with\nreflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social\nimplications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.",

      "title": "Mitigating Attention Hacking in Preference-Based Reward Modeling via\n  Interaction Distillation",
      "summary": "The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for\nproviding reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference\nmodeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its\njudgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to\ncontext. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference\nmodeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal\nattention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within\nthe prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm\ninduces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and\nrejected sequences. To address this \"attention hacking\", we propose\n\"Interaction Distillation\", a novel training framework for more adequate\npreference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces\nan interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to\nprovide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,\nand guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction\npattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive\nexperiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide\nmore stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM\noptimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking\nconstitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.",

One such\ndomain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of\na number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex\necosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the\nrealm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to\nlocalize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and\nLLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\napproach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an\naverage of 79.8\\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.\nWe then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical\nfor bug resolution, i.e. bug localization.

While generative models offer a solution,\ntraditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language\nModels (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,\nleading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nStructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs\nwith robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.\nFirst, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a\nhigh-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to\nadhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated\ndata respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher\nstructural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It\nproves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully\nnavigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.",

      "title": "CharBench: Evaluating the Role of Tokenization in Character-Level Tasks",
      "summary": "Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating\ncharacters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A\ncommon conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather\nthan characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet\nrecent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,\nleaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of\nmagnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of\nleading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it\npresents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of\n43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic\nproperties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model\nperformance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are\nweakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and\nthe actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks\nrequiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively\ncorrelated with the length of the token containing the queried character,\nsuggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.\nWe encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology\nintroduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.",

      "summary": "Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as\na method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while\nmitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,\ncurrent approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve\nunstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations\nthat are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel\nframework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the\nform of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We\nuse a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks\nand semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct\nstructured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable\npathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,\nproviding a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE\ncan significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models\n(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior\nmethods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages\nof incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining\nmultiple LLM outputs.",

To\naddress this challenge, we propose \\textbf{CA}usal \\textbf{MA}thematician\n(\\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,\nreusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs\nthe \\textbf{M}athematical \\textbf{C}ausal \\textbf{G}raph (\\textbf{MCG}), a\nhigh-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with\ncausal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The\nresulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.\nTo better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines\nthe MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the\nquestion-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA\ndynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both\nthe question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,\nwhich encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal\ndependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning\nprocess. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly\nimproves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our\nexperiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms\nunstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal\nrelationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations\nalone.",

We introduce a novel\nmethod to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing\ntaxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the\nattention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy\nand the attention weights involved in decoding.\n  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect\ndistinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that\nmaximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:\nmemorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized\nsamples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and\nnon-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization\ndoes not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism.
