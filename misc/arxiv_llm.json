      "title": "VideoITG: Multimodal Video Understanding with Instructed Temporal\n  Grounding",
      "summary": "Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video\nframes can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,\nemploying separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing\ntemporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt\nunsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex\nscenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding\nfor Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user\ninstructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated\nannotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.\nFirst, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the\ninstruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through\ninstruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection\nto pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we\nconstruct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed\ntemporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding.",

      "title": "VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.",

      "summary": "Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,\nwhilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on\nshort pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour\nform. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that\nrequires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a\ndataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality\nexplanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,\ncontemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on\nreasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding\nnews events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot\nabilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of\ndifferent types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour\nexplanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are\ncapable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further\nhighlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly\nsimple joke forms.",

This survey introduces\nContext Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design\nto encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We\npresent a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its\nfoundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate\nthem into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:\ncontext retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We\nthen explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create\nsophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nmemory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through\nthis systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only\nestablishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical\nresearch gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While\ncurrent models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate\nremarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit\npronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.\nAddressing this gap is a defining priority for future research.

      "title": "The Imitation Game: Turing Machine Imitator is Length Generalizable\n  Reasoner",
      "summary": "Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than\nthose observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based\nlarge language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.",

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates\ndiverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial\ninformation, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as\ndeveloping countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large\nlanguage model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM\nfunctioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable\neffective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different\nstages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in\nestimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with\nlimited data availability.",

      "title": "The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in\n  Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations",
      "summary": "The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several\napproaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.",

To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a\nmeta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used\nautomated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task.

      "summary": "In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by\ntaking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,\nLLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature\nsuggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to\noffer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees\ncould improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable\nnatural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.\nTo address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language\nthat can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural\nlanguage-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using\nsuch a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the\nuser's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the\nAnsible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a\ncalculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic\ninterpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21\ncode-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of\ncases and identify incorrect code in 92%.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging\npretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen\ntasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context\nlearning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it\nstill faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and\nefficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be\nachieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input\nexpansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of\nLLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples\nhave consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we\npropose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that\nenables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation\nstates. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from\nhigh-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced\nactivations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks.

Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination.
