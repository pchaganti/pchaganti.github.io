      "title": "On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with\n  Reward Rectification",
      "summary": "We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited\ngeneralization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical\nanalysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic\nreward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of\nmodel. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing\ngradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function\nwith the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change\nsignificantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks\nand base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,\nour approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an\neffective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and\npractical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be\navailable at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.",

      "title": "How Do LLMs Persuade? Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in\n  Multi-Turn Conversations",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.",

      "title": "Simulating Human-Like Learning Dynamics with LLM-Empowered Agents",
      "summary": "Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a\nmajor research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior.",

      "title": "TrajEvo: Trajectory Prediction Heuristics Design via LLM-driven\n  Evolution",
      "summary": "Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,\nespecially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous\nvehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often\nlack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer\nimproved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,\nlimited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo\noutperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and\nnotably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to\nan unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the\nautomated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction\nheuristics.

      "title": "Cooper: Co-Optimizing Policy and Reward Models in Reinforcement Learning\n  for Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in\nreasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm\nfor enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that\ndynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,\nproviding a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.",

      "title": "Uni-cot: Towards Unified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Text and\n  Vision",
      "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

      "title": "MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging\n  Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy",
      "summary": "Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical\nreasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,\nhigh-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on\ntransforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.\nWe propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging\nmathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing\nproblems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling\nconcept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and\navoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined\nstrategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts\nreinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning\ncomplexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated\nunder autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,\nencouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with\nlong-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,\ncategorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,\nOlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines\nunder both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused\nvariant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.\nOverall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and\ntransferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in\nadvancing LLM reasoning capabilities.",

      "title": "DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label\n  Recognition",
      "summary": "Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple\nseen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise\nintra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class\nreasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive\nTransfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed\nusing structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs\ngraph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between\nclass representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to\nexplicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive\ninter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class\nrefinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, validating its effectiveness.",

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical\nphenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable\nclinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In\naddition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a\nsynthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and\niteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,\ncoupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably\naccurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods\nwhile requiring significantly fewer training examples.",

      "summary": "Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training\nloop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely\nrecognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT\nresearch focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,\nwhere the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No\nexisting method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this\nceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),\nand then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\\pm i$,\nthe first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,\nour method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to\nboost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity\n$\\{\\pm1, \\pm i\\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically\noptimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a\nzero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only\nadditions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\\pm i$\noutperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of\nboth PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute\nefficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and\npractical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.",
