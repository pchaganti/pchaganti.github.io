      "title": "CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the\nrapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for\nautomated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.",

      "title": "Automated Interpretation of Non-Destructive Evaluation Contour Maps\n  Using Large Language Models for Bridge Condition Assessment",
      "summary": "Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,\nand Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing\nstructural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and\nrequires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this\nanalysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities\nfor interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in\nproviding detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine\nmodels provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of\ntopics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models\nare summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of\nthe bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more\neffective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an\ninnovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and\nsummarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and\nenhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.",

      "title": "Lessons from the TREC Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n  (PLABA) track",
      "summary": "Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt\nprofessional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it\naccessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.",

      "summary": "Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet\nchallenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human\nbehaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents\noften fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as\ndomain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of\nmind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process\ntheory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)\nmodule to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental\ncharacteristic reasoning.

      "summary": "Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an\nElectronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a\npatient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings.",

We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on\ntasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question\nanswering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate\nthat there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all\ntasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks.

      "summary": "Agentic AI systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer\ntransformative potential for value co-creation in technical services. However,\npersistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit\ntheir autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide\nhuman-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and\nanalogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured\ntaxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within\ntechnical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes\ncollaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by\nthe Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the\nHuman-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the\nframework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the\nHuman-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human\napproval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows\nwith deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation\nupon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables\ndiscretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of\nthis work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key\ncontingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system\nreliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a\nsystematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human\noversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the\ntrade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of\nsafer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.",

We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with\nstructural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance\nand efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a\nlightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and\nsubstantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge\nretrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,\noutperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches\nwhile keeping communication overhead comparable.

By integrating high-bandwidth\nHBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D\nelectro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory\nalongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM\nenables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies\nmore efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint\nthat limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current\nXPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a\nlightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems.

      "summary": "The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of\nmodelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.\nTraditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to\ncapture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their\nstrong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently\ndesigned to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On\nthe other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which\nis good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user\npreference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for\ncomprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec\n(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that\nleverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the\ntemporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of\nthe fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users\nevolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM\nvariants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies\nthat users might enjoy.

      "summary": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow\nthe progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results.

However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly\npositional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the\naccuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are\nmore likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice\nQuestion Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect\nprediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We\nfirst show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to\nhuman-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering\nresponse options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring\nknowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this\napproach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our\nfindings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and\nopportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP\napplications.",

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization).

This domain is appealing since we have an\nabundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,\nand the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.\nResults show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they\ngenerally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which\ngreatly contributes to their poor quality.",
