      "title": "SIMS-V: Simulated Instruction-Tuning for Spatial Video Understanding",
      "summary": "Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models\nstruggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial\ntraining approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage\nwith precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this\nbottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that\nleverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich\nvideo training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we\ninvestigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world\ntransfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We\nidentify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,\nperspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most\neffective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming\ncomprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights\nenable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just\n25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves\ncompetitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial\nreasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,\nmaintaining performance on general video understanding while showing\nsubstantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.",

      "summary": "LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but\nthey cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct\nanswers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a\nneuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from\nCoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order\nlogic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,\ncommonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation\nenables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises\nallow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.\nExperiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT\neffectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of\nfinal answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for\n(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nVeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct\npreference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,\nfurther improving reasoning validity and accuracy.",

      "title": "DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for\n  Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration",
      "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.",

While current state-of-the-art approaches\nleverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,\nthese methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks\nin real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a\nlightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can\neffectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification\ntasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system\nachieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient.

      "summary": "While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved\nremarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding\ntasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains\nan active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder\nfundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded\nin long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing\nboth visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and\nprocess lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an\nautomated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,\nlong-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we\nconstruct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million\nsamples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and\npropose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating\nfine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual\ndescriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP\nshowcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form\ntexts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

      "summary": "A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'\nassemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to\nengage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to\npropose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due\nto time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of\nquestions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce\nan auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a\nslate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified\nrepresentation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the\ngeneral utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime\nof $O(mn\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number\nof proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical\ndeliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions\nposed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions\nchosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current\nlimitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our\nmethods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over\nhundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for\npractitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.",

      "summary": "\"Thinking with Text\" and \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm significantly\nimprove the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

While a number of LLM code\nsecurity benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the\nsecurity of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have\nimpacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest\nopen-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability\nscenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality\ntrade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To\nhelp address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the\nrisk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability\nseverity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces\nvulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation\nof the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the\nModel Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of\nvulnerabilities a model generates.",

      "summary": "Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great\npotential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.\nThese reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct\ntypes: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of\nfindings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on\nthe context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of\nuncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when\nradiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or\ndiagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent\nor simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part\nframework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,\nLLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding\nto a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit\nuncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds\ncharacteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for\n14 common diagnoses.

      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in\nspecialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing\nevaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to\ncapture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge\napproaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper\nintroduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for\nthe rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an\nagentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)\ndatasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to\nensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge\nmetrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to\nachieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to\nevaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military\noperations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is\nhighly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter\nconfiguration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis\non the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG.

Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.",
