      "title": "Agentic Design of Compositional Machines",
      "summary": "The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence\nand a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.",

      "title": "Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs",
      "summary": "This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for\ndiffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while\nminimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and\nprogramming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a\nresult, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently\ndepending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To\nmeasure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework\nthat applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants\ndiffering only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones\nwith over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial\nshifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates\nin early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token\nboundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle\nto reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for\ngrammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.",

      "title": "Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective\n  Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents",
      "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with\nreinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external\nenvironments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that\nrequire multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that\nIGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,\nachieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.",

We show\nthat averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with\nadditive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear\nlink functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we\nfind empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks\nadditivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw\ndata of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce\nsubstantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We\nderive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a\nbox-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At\n33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \\pm 0.008$ while preserving agent\nrankings (Spearman $\\rho = 0.972 \\pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations\nthan full dense.

      "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they\nstruggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on\nvisual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often\nlimited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,\nstrategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow\nunified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for\nmathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation\nstage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M\ncaption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing\ntrajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.\nSecond, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on\nMathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual\nreasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To\nfacilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging\nbenchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved\nvisual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks.

Curated from authoritative public\nresources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics\nresearch: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our\nevaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance\npatterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text\ngeneration tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even\nwith retrieval augmentation.

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not\nonly improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with\nremarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time\nscaling performance.",

      "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying\nerrors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of\nscalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human\nlabeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte\nCarlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes\nand often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit\nmisattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,\nlow factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level\nvalidation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation\nmechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.\nFinally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative\nstructure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned\nLLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,\namounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with\nauto-labeled supervision.

      "summary": "Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability\nworldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to\nsubjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low\nawareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify\ndepression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for\nscalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early\ndetection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nmachine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of\n553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth\ndiagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We\nbenchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1\nMini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank\nAdaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic\ncategories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and\n98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments\nimproves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection\nsensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with\nlower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive\nperformance across evaluation metrics.

In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk\npredicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap\nbetween nominal and epistemic stability.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,\nyet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context\nwindow and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature\nand inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable\noutput, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly\nwhen interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such\nas codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nGatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs\nagent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate\nand reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity \"latent state\" representation of the\nsystem to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All\ninteractions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a\ndeclarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the\nsystem remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the\nGatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this\napproach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational\nefficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction\nwith complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more\nrobust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge\ndomain.",
