      "title": "Language-Image Alignment with Fixed Text Encoders",
      "summary": "Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image\nalignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive\nlearning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such\na costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a\npre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder\nto guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn\nLanguage-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by\ntraining only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive\nbenchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework\nLIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve\ncompositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable\ngains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards\nsystematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual\nlearning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning\nlanguage-aligned visual representations.",

      "title": "EPiC: Towards Lossless Speedup for Reasoning Training through\n  Edge-Preserving CoT Condensation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities\nwhen trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and\nverbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models\n(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the\ndistillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate\nthe reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and\nbenchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving\nlossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore thought-level CoT\ncondensation for efficient reasoning model distillation.",

      "title": "Cascadia: A Cascade Serving System for Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to\ndeliver both rapid responses and high-quality answers. More powerful models\nyield better results but incur higher inference latency, whereas smaller models\nare faster yet less capable. Recent work proposes balancing this\nlatency-quality trade-off using model cascades, which route simpler queries to\nsmaller models and more complex ones to larger models. However, enabling\nefficient cascade serving remains challenging. Current frameworks lack\neffective mechanisms for handling (i) the huge and varying resource demands of\ndifferent LLMs, (ii) the inherent heterogeneity of LLM workloads, and (iii) the\nco-optimization of system deployment and routing strategy. Motivated by these\nobservations, we introduce Cascadia, a novel cascade serving framework designed\nexplicitly to schedule request routing and deploy model cascades for fast,\nquality-preserving LLM serving. Cascadia employs a bi-level optimization\nmethod: at the inner level, it uses a mixed-integer linear program to select\nresource allocations and parallelism strategies based on LLM information and\nworkload characteristics; at the outer level, it applies a weighted Tchebycheff\nalgorithm to iteratively co-optimize the routing strategy and the system\ndeployment produced by the inner level. Our extensive evaluation on diverse\nworkload traces and different model cascades (DeepSeek and the Llama series)\ndemonstrates that Cascadia significantly outperforms both single-model\ndeployments and the state-of-the-art cascade serving baseline, achieving up to\n4x (2.3x on average) tighter latency SLOs and up to 5x (2.4x on average) higher\nthroughput while maintaining target answer quality.",

      "summary": "Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world\napplications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and\nlong-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to\nencompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as\nmodels often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction\ntrajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel\nreinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to\nenable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search\ninteraction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via\nmulti-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and\nknowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when\nto retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep\nknowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training,\nR-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the\nreasoning-search trajectory.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based\nframework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text\ngeneration. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through\nplanning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model\nto follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a\nprofessional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised\nfine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM.

      "title": "SkipGPT: Dynamic Layer Pruning Reinvented with Token Awareness and\n  Module Decoupling",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but\nincur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered\narchitectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these\ninefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical\ndynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level\nheterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical\ndynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers\nnecessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a\ndynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource\nallocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to\nprioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and\nself-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a\ntwo-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that\nlearns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning\ndecisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore\nperformance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the\nperformance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing\ndynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical\ndeployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT.",

      "summary": "Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in\nmachine learning. It adds another layer of complexity when this data contain\nclass imbalance problems. This paper presents a novel token-aware data\nimputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large\nlanguage models. This is achieved through the combination of a structured\ngroup-wise CSV-style prompting technique and the elimination of irrelevant\ncontextual information in the input prompt. We test this approach with two\nclass-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness\nof imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt\nsize while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline\nprompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The\ncontributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the\nimportance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation\nand 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for\nclass-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution\nwithin computational constraints.

We address this gap by analyzing how Copilot for Microsoft\nWord, a LLM-based assistant, impacts users. Using tasks ranging from objective\n(SAT reading comprehension) to subjective (personal reflection), and with\nmeasurements including fNIRS, Empatica E4, NASA-TLX, and questionnaires, we\nmeasure Copilot's effects on users. We also evaluate users' performance with\nand without Copilot across tasks. In objective tasks, participants reported a\nreduction of workload and an increase in enjoyment, which was paired with\nobjective performance increases. Participants reported reduced workload and\nincreased enjoyment with no change in performance in a creative poetry writing\ntask. However, no benefits due to Copilot use were reported in a highly\nsubjective self-reflection task. Although no physiological changes were\nrecorded due to Copilot use, task-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex\nactivation offer complementary insights into the cognitive processes associated\nwith successful and unsuccessful human-AI collaboration.

      "summary": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because\nmedical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current\nmedical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive\nmedical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have\nlimitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often\nnot derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor\nassessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present\nLLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996\nquestions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed\nclinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline,\nincorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework.\nFurthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine\nagreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert\nfeedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories\n(specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on\nLLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment\nof LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in\nhttps://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.",
