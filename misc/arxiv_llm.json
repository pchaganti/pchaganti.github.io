      "title": "TeachLM: Post-Training LLMs for Education Using Authentic Learning Data",
      "summary": "The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the\npedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack\nof access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual\nstudents. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of\nprompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language\nis inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM\noptimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of\nstate-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000\nhours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by\nPolygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.\nWe use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model\nthat enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.\nBuilding on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol\nthat leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and\nreproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our\nevaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data\nsignificantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling\nstudent talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by\n50%, and greater personalization of instruction.",

      "title": "SwiReasoning: Switch-Thinking in Latent and Explicit for Pareto-Superior\n  Reasoning LLMs",
      "summary": "Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit\nchain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural\nlanguages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent\nspace, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token\nefficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under\nconstrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,\nwith larger gains as budgets tighten.",

      "title": "Boomerang Distillation Enables Zero-Shot Model Size Interpolation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed under diverse memory and\ncompute constraints. Existing approaches build model families by training each\nsize independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only\ncoarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that\nwe call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher),\none first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs\nintermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the\nstudent without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot\ninterpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales\nsmoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing\npretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this\ntype of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and\nstudent through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation\nthus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model\nfamilies, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible\nadaptation across deployment environments. The code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/dcml-lab/boomerang-distillation.",

While\nmulti-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly\nincrease the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for\nlatency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this\nissue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.\nInstead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,\nwe begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs\nfrom these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming\nreduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.",

      "summary": "The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated\nrobust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving\nadversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search\nfor successful queries. Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often\nfail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct,\na novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous\njailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries\nwith \"spurious responses\" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak\nattacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses\nprovide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the\nadversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the\njailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,\njailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\\%. When combined with\nother defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest\nattack strategies to 0\\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that\ncan serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most\neffective jailbreaking attacks.",

      "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model\nextreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this\ninformation at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover\nan interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data\nimplicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different\ngeneration orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that\ncommitting to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice,\ncollapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address\nthis, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time\nscaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous\nblock schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation\npaths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed\nschedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to\n3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and\nspecialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even\nyields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific\nreasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%.\nOur results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based\nLLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a\ncritical role in determining performance during inference.",

      "summary": "Large language models are sometimes trained with imperfect oversight signals,\nleading to undesired behaviors such as reward hacking and sycophancy. Improving\noversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that\nimprove learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce\nInoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that\nprevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to\nexplicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we\nmodify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only\nworks on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we\nfind that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially\nreducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which\nmore strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more\neffectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this\nserves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is\na simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning,\npreventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting\ndesired capabilities.",

So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple\nquestion-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to\nevaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the\ndiscipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and\nAstrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual\nunderstanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average\nscores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing\nmodels) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top\ntwo among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated\n(2022-2025).

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning\ntasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and\nuniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT\naddresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to\nminimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by\nthis insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for\nonline RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort\nto the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike\nconventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation\nand sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically\nstops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize\nupdates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute\nadvantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive\nsampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and\nreasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and\nimproves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced\nsampling variant.
