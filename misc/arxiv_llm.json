      "title": "Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training\n  Quantization for Diffusion LLMs",
      "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a\npromising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language\ngeneration tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding\nstrategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and\nexperimental setups will be released to support the community.",

      "summary": "Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown\nimpressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research\nsystems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking\nand synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown\nimpressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain\nchallenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited\naccuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model\nlacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the\nframework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored\nfor medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses\nthese challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data\nsynthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest\nchains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex\nmulti-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private\nmedical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate\nmedical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse\ntrajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool\ninteractions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised\nfine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our\nMedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing\nnew state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining\ncompetitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates\nthat strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and\ntraining data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform\nmuch larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.",

      "summary": "Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications\nlike reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.",

      "summary": "Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective\ninteraction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and\nneural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper\npresents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating\ndifferences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between\nexperts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural\nsignatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including\nincreased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle\ntemporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency\ndynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into\nthe neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the\nimplications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with\nLLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to\ncognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of\nAI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows.

      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical\napplications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major\nchallenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In\naddition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial\nsuffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of\noptimized suffixes to different LLMs.",

      "summary": "Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked\nimpressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the\nreasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct\ntranslated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen\n2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT\ngeneration across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments\nreveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune\nusing only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\\% in Swahili. Third,\ndata quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully\ncurated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier\ncorpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results\nclarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated\ndatasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.",

However, gauging student understanding in college courses is bottlenecked\nby large class sizes, which limits assessments to a multiple-choice (MC) format\nfor ease of grading. Although sufficient in quantifying scientifically correct\nconceptions, MC assessments do not uncover students' deeper ways of\nunderstanding physics. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach\nfor assessing students' written responses at scale. Our study used an LLM,\nvalidated by human graders, to classify students' written explanations to three\nquestions on the Energy and Momentum Conceptual Survey as correct or incorrect,\nand organized students' incorrect explanations into emergent categories. We\nfound that the LLM (GPT-4o) can fairly assess students' explanations,\ncomparable to human graders (0-3% discrepancy).

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this\nunstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even\nstate-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages\nfrom across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input\ntokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable\nacross health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)\ngenerating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using\nEHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs\nwith varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval\nor the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds\nthe performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using\nthe models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our\nresults suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as\nnewer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.",

      "summary": "Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple\ntasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand\nprediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three\ntasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised\nand zero-shot settings.

Beyond sampling\nefficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to\nkeep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated\ngrowth in sample and computational complexity.

The findings suggest that\nalthough LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of\nsoftware defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\nThese defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared\nweaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code\ngeneration methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded\npasswords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple\nmodels.
