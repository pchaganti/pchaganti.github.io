      "title": "Advancing Medical Artificial Intelligence Using a Century of Cases",
      "summary": "BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine\nClinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert\nphysicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.",

      "title": "Survival at Any Cost? LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and\n  Human Harm",
      "summary": "When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language\nModels (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/alirezamohamadiam/DECIDE-SIM",

      "title": "RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model\n  Role-playing",
      "summary": "Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in\nhigh-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where\nfailures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy\nincorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens\nfrom the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing\ninteractions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and\nremain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)\nmethods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,\nhuman-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.",

While prior work has demonstrated these risks, little is known about\nhow users estimate and respond. We conducted a survey with 240 U.S.\nparticipants who judged text snippets for inference risks, reported concern\nlevels, and attempted rewrites to block inference. We compared their rewrites\nwith those generated by ChatGPT and Rescriber, a state-of-the-art sanitization\ntool.

We then propose OpenHOUSE\n(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends\nstreaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a\nspecialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely\nadjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of\nexisting methods.

      "title": "UniPar: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Parallel and Accelerated Code\n  Translation in HPC",
      "summary": "Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an\nimportant problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing\ntools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent\nexplosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their\nability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach.\nToward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs\nto translate between parallel languages.\n  In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for\nLLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target\ntranslations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how\nwell current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and\nLLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known\nstrategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization\nfor decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and\niterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation,\nwe construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel\ntranslation and cross-paradigm transformations.\n  Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the\ndefault settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15%\nfunctional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning,\nhyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up\nto 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will\nprovide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the\nparallel language translation problem.\n  UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub\nrepository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in text-only \"slow-thinking\" reasoning have prompted efforts\nto transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training\nvisual reasoning models (\\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical\nchallenges: Effective \"slow thinking\" in VRMs requires \\textbf{visual\nreflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual\ninformation. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs\nexhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information\ndiminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a new VRM \\textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection\nbased on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for\nreinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning\ndata by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,\nenabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual\nattention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based\non visual information. Therefore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates\nsignificant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.\nFurthermore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent\nreliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective\nenhancement in visual reflection capabilities.",

Consequently, LLMs are\nincreasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces\ncritical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization\nat scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To\naddress this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning\n(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization\nwhile preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nframework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture\ndomain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free\noptimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach\neliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,\nrequiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective\nadaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense\nreasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic\nprocessing and privacy preservation.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ntheir capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising\ngeneral-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated\nby these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs\nfor the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection\ntasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target\ndetection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in\nchallenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting\nprimarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature\npatterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to\nunseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel\nfine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike\nconventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,\nthis loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on\ntheir online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the\nmost generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem\nas selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine\nradar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the\noriginal one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR\nscenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nacross diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under\nlimited training data conditions.",

Considering the high\ndependence (over 90%) on TPLs in practical programming, demystifying and\nanalyzing LLMs' code translation performance involving various TPLs becomes\nimperative. To address this gap, we construct TransLibEval, the first benchmark\ndedicated to library-centric code translation.

However, despite\nsignificant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face\nchallenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve\naccuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically\npartition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By\nprioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates\nmore bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space\nquota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize\ndimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error.\nTo speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first\nquantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized\nvectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive\nenumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical\nmethods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ,\nExtended RabitQ).
