      "title": "JoyAgents-R1: Joint Evolution Dynamics for Versatile Multi-LLM Agents\n  with Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm\nfor increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous\nagents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training\ninstability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal\nbenefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with\nmaximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve\ntraining stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter\nadjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution\nmechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to\neliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across\ngeneral and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves\nperformance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller\nopen-source models.",

      "summary": "Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased\ntheir powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,\ncurrent unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update\ncosts, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

      "title": "KnowRL: Exploring Knowledgeable Reinforcement Learning for Factuality",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often\nexhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability\nto accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its\noutcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the\nthinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on\nthree hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets\ndemonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking\nmodels while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

      "summary": "This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social\nsimulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to\nsocial science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.",

      "summary": "Despite extensive research on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems (ML-NIDS), their capability to detect diverse attack variants\nremains uncertain. Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,\nwhich artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of\nsecurity. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack\nvariants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to\ndepend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of\nsystem designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to\ngeneralize across diverse attack types.\n  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided\nmachine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML\nsystematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It\nconstructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it\napplies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain\nknowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.\n  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly\ncollected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail\nto detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %. In\ncontrast, our knowledge-guided approach achieves up to 99 % F1 score while\nmaintaining a False Positive Rate below 0.1 %.",

In this work, we first establish that guiding Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as\nsemantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval\neffectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,\nand SciFact.

SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit\nShaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative\nlearning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new\nstate-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent\nbehavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary\nexploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without\nsacrificing performance.

KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and\ndiscovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine\nlearning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)\nextraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and\nhas been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to\nmore recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs\nis explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts\nfor LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle\nchanges in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy\ngeneration) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this\nchallenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given\ninput-output examples.\n  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt\noptimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We\nevaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM\nbeing used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of\ncanonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and\ndiversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,\nand (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three\ndifferent automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use\ntwo different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous\nempirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt\noptimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for\ntriple extraction.
