      "title": "LLM-Based Config Synthesis requires Disambiguation",
      "summary": "Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is\nambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking\ncontext for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and\nACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative\npriority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.\nMeasurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,\nshowing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,\nwhich uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps\nelicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally\nsynthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our\ntreatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates\ncan be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and\ncan lead to different global behaviors.",

      "title": "Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and\n  Internal Data",
      "summary": "Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR\nrecords, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical\ndecision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Perf, the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on code\nperformance optimization tasks within authentic repository contexts.

We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on\ngenerating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating\nsimplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs\nacross varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate\nsuccess rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text\nprompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on\nlarger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models\ngenerally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not\nuniversally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,\nand successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality.

      "summary": "Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only\nlanguage models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of\ninformation) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex\ninformation to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle\nin the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial\nnumber of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual\nlanguage models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based\nvision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based\nmulti-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do\nnot support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires\ncomputation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.\nLastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the\napproximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval\nprocess. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval\nprocess scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We\npropose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search\n(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to\nretrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate\nanswers from contextualized best matching pages.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training\ndata, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,\nhowever, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time\ninformation retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While\nprior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,\ntheir capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains\nunexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic\nattributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic\ndataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international\nparticipants, we show that these models can access social media content and\npredict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic\ndataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,\nwhich may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal\nactivity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science\nin the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information\noperations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We\nrecommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing\napplications, while preserving controlled access for verified research\npurposes.",

However, they face challenges such as\nambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to\nenhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The\nframework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and\nMistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate\nframework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B\nvariants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving\na notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex\nambiguities and efficient consensus.

      "summary": "While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,\nDeepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains\na critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like\nbackdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning\nmechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this\nvulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously\ndegrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To\naddress this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought\nPurity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to\nmalicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves\nthis through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data\nprocessing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)\nadaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive\ndefense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement\nlearning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the\nsecurity-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks\nand domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL.",
