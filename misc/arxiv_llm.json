      "title": "BetterCheck: Towards Safeguarding VLMs for Automotive Perception Systems",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal\ndata such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in\nunderstanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks\n(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited\nvocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being\nnon-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models\n(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.\nThis is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception\nsystems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case\nsituation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to\neither potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who\nare present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in\nreality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving\nsystems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous\ndecisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe\nthat both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding\ncapabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult\nto spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements\nin their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such\nas BetterCheck that we propose in our work.",

      "title": "AI Telephone Surveying: Automating Quantitative Data Collection with an\n  AI Interviewer",
      "summary": "With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,\nquantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI\ntelephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can\nscale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like\ninteractivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used\ninteractive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI\nenables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust\nto interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.\n  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on\nlarge language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech\nsynthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative\nresearch, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order\nrandomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.\n  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot\nsurveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate\nhuman-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three\nkey metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent\nsatisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more\nresponsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three\nmetrics studied.",

      "title": "From Feedback to Checklists: Grounded Evaluation of AI-Generated\n  Clinical Notes",
      "summary": "AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but\nevaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and\nlimited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to\nalign with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a\npipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured\nchecklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be\ninterpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based\nevaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,\nprepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI\nmedical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms\nbaseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and\npredictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the\nchecklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant\nalignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation\nmethodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify\nnotes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based\nadapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a\nseparate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,\nposing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile\ndevices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they\ntypically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we\nintroduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the\ninherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike\nexisting methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and\nperformance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and\nperformance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage\nsize (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving\ncompetitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing\nmerging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse\nstorage efficiency.",

      "title": "Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts\n  Language Models",
      "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from\ncomputational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a\nprincipled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE\nmodels.",

      "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large\nlanguage model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a\nstep-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle\ncomplex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,\n[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not\nactually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning\nactually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we\nrevisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist\nwhen tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,\nPython interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and\ntheir LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show\nthat, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning\ncounterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the\nrecent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of\ntool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.",

      "title": "Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks",
      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a\nvital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time\ndecision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users.\nThis shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach,\nwhere artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to\nartificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess\nbroader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with\nreal-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic\nagents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty\nsteering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers\nsupervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and\nimplement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,\nand (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We\nfurther propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on\na 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show\nthat symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone\nLLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy\nwith a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of\n82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world\ntestbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and\nresource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.\nDrawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the\nsymbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven\nnetworks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even\nas LLMs advance.",

By employing Gemini to\nidentify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the\nmost prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code\ntransformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original\nstrings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method\novercomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques,\neliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving\nreliability and flexibility.

      "summary": "Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse\nstakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable\nalternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder\nperspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)\nmodelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models\n(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles\nto experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a\n\"scaffold\" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting\nusers in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across\nperspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the\ncontext of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both\nnarrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a\nuser successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher\n- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform\nevidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various\ninstitutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound\npolicies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and\nimplementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world\nmisalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's\nreflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment\nas a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political\nneutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user\nexhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing\nstrategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different\nperspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new\nforms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.",

      "summary": "The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on\nmanual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the\nperformance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise\nfor reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from\nsupervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.\nHowever, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different\nmeta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box\nfunctions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical\ncomparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned\nalgorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to\nmeta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the\ninterpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.\nBased on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL\nalgorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as\nperformant as possible.",

      "summary": "Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet\nempirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of\nexisting classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,\nit introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for\ncross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity.

Model merging techniques have\nemerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain.

      "title": "CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs)\nin the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's\nexecution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether\na specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for\ndownstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior\napproaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code\nreasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize\nacross diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low\nquality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which\nstruggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we\npropose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a\ntwo-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets\nthat focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply\ninstruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a\npowerful teacher model.

MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:\nlanguage-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition\nreasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition\nreasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English\nequivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation\nfrom native speakers fluent in English.

We systematically evaluate current 14\nleading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent\nset. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native\nmultilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs\nexhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and\nlogical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math\nreasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating\npersistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.",
