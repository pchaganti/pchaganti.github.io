      "title": "Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings",
      "summary": "Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively\nmeaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such\nrepresentations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to\nserve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven\nnotoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the\nrequired perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical\nmethods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still\nlacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,\nextracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.\nsweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding\nprototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the\nLLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space\ndimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.",

      "title": "Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from\n  the Arab World",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting\ntheir effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has\nexplored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using\nalignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense\nreasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities\ncoexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded\ncommonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate\nlightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and\ndemonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised\nfine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12\nculture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by\n10\\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that\nout-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or\nsurpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural\ncommonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate\nthat efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising\napproach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.",

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data",
      "summary": "The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational\nresources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains\nconventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.",

However, existing MAS initialization methods do\nnot fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in\nsubsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we\npropose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.\nSpecifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between\nagents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to\nFormat mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team\nselection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to\njointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective\nand efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance.

      "title": "CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when\nprocessing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.\nWhile soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent\nrepresentations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited.\nExisting techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which\nleads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse\ncomputations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we\nintroduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical\ndeployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it\ninto segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice\nyields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales\nlinearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short\nsequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and\nreusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across\ndifferent queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at\nhigh context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x\nand reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance\ncomparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses\nit on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical\nutility.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational\nArtificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the\navoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly\nfor large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and\nevaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to\nusers as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of\npossible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes\ntransparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs,\ntimestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and\nG-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and\nempirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query\nmismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments.\nThese findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate,\nuser-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational\nfluency and factual accuracy.",

However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily\nfocus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training\nprocess and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters.

Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.",

We announce the first public release\nof CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and\nSchreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles\nmuch larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.\n  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier\ngraphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric\ngroups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of\nquadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is\na general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem\nbeing NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on\ndiameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to\nprevious O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to\ninvolutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the\ndiameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15.

      "summary": "The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user\ninterface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually\nwritten executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to\nmaintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the\npossibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper\ninvestigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness\nand on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound,\nas they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable\nagent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may\nlead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail\nmechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution\nof each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs\nin test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose\na definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case\nexecution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six\nSigma.

      "title": "A Mega-Study of Digital Twins Reveals Strengths, Weaknesses and\n  Opportunities for Further Improvement",
      "summary": "Do \"digital twins\" capture individual responses in surveys and experiments?\nWe run 19 pre-registered studies on a national U.S. panel and their LLM-powered\ndigital twins (constructed based on previously-collected extensive\nindividual-level data) and compare twin and human answers across 164 outcomes.\nThe correlation between twin and human answers is modest (approximately 0.2 on\naverage) and twin responses are less variable than human responses. While\nconstructing digital twins based on rich individual-level data improves our\nability to capture heterogeneity across participants and predict relative\ndifferences between them, it does not substantially improve our ability to\npredict the exact answers given by specific participants or enhance predictions\nof population means. Twin performance varies by domain and is higher among more\neducated, higher-income, and ideologically moderate participants. These results\nsuggest current digital twins can capture some degree of relative differences\nbut are unreliable for individual-level predictions and sample mean and\nvariance estimation, underscoring the need for careful validation before use.\nOur data and code are publicly available for researchers and practitioners\ninterested in optimizing digital twin pipelines.",
