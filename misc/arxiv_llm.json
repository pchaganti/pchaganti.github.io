      "summary": "LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a\none-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user\npreferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with\nspecific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge\nthis gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging\nsetting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per\nuser -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited\nData (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --\nDnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We\nfurther propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages\nhigh-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best\noverall performance.",

While recent research has explored the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also\nsupport explanation and correction remain limited. We present MisVisFix, an\ninteractive dashboard that leverages both Claude and GPT models to support the\nfull workflow of detecting, explaining, and correcting misleading\nvisualizations. MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and\naddresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as\nmajor, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations,\nactionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An\ninteractive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or\nrequest modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation\nstrategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization\nexperts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately\nidentifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement.

      "summary": "The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial\nfor advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation\nwhen processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant\ninformation in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory\nrecall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'\ncapabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active\nContext Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working\nmemory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three\ncategories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,\nand (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage\ntheir attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus\non relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental\nevaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and\nNeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly\nimproves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent\ntool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context\nManagement, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also\nprovides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse\nlong-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,\nrather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.",

A cost-effective yet high-impact way is\nto pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches\neither rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,\nwhich is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference\nalignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating\ninstructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more\nhuman-preferred form.

      "summary": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines\ninto conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant\nindustrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their\nhigh computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.\nExisting compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.\nlow-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered\nstructure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a\ndimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

      "summary": "Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation\nediting is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there\nexists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades\ntruthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness.

However, their inherent dependence\non static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual\naccuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,\noffer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable\nmemory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat\nreasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of new information and hindering real-time updates.

Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm.

To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data.
