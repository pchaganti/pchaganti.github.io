      "summary": "Intelligence analysts perform sensemaking over collections of documents using\nvarious visual and analytic techniques to gain insights from large amounts of\ntext. As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI\ntechnologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a\nvisual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep\npace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual\nanalytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into\nvarious UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles,\nperforming sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on\npiles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the\ntool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts\nthat used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.",

      "title": "Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning\ncapabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large\nreasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.",

      "summary": "Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to\nevaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their\ncomplexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face\nlimitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient\ntest case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.\nTo address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,\neach with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced\ndirectly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted\nbetween 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key\nfeatures: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask\nrubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite\ncontestant performance data to enable informative comparison against\ntop-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from\nnewly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system\nfacilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular\ngeneral-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable\n81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human\ncontestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among\nopen-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,\nunderscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.\nDetailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise\nproblem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should\nemphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration.

The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a\nsharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes\nclassic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)\nsteady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating\naround controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video\nactivity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a\ngrowing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,\nparameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight\nvision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building\nencoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;\ncontrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and\ndistillation.

      "title": "GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge\n  Graphs from Unstructured Data",
      "summary": "Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)\napplications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide\nabstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of\nthe two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not\nrealized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In\naddition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural\napproaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a\ngold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the\nsymbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora\nhas remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing\nGraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs\nfrom unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT\nand its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of\nabstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the\nfirst efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art\nbenchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to\nbaselines.\n  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual\n(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with\ndomain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,\nQwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to\nprompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On\ntext obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT\nyields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG\nthat achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher\nValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.",

To streamline this\nprocess and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic\nPromotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,\nengaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release\nPRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to\nhigh-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity\n(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment\n(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent\nframework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with\nmultimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and\nplatform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum\nreach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%\nrise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement.

      "summary": "Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in\nsparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing\nhallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from\nin-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise\nfrom concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)\nenable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and\ntaxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting\napplicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE\nframework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's\nlatent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,\nthen using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword\nset per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure\ncomprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through\ndiverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense\nretrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query\nsignals, boosting performance in dense settings.

However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into\ncoarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We\ntackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025\nM4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual\nsemantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video\nsubtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise\nknowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node\nembeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query\ntime, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search\nprunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a\nlightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive\ncross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on\nthe mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation\nstudies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical\nindexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking.

      "summary": "Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high\nthroughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive\nalternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which\nenables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often\nrequired for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core\nParallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and\ncomplex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for\ndirectly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to\nautoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive\nprompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking\nwithout improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,\nreasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we\nintroduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and\nsequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,\ndiffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these\nfindings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented\nprompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce\nPSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.",

      "summary": "Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to\ngeneralize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a\ncritical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:\ncompositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying\ncomplex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate\nrepresentations through iterative application of inference rules. In the\nliterature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella\nterm of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the\nlogical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)\nusing the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.\nThough simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of\nformal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning\nabilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate\nreasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.\nTo overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we\npropose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural\ncomputation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient\ninference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning\nensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved\neven with relatively small neural components.

We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted\nmodel that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the\nuntrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for\nthis information autonomously.

Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade\ndiverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control\nbenchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on\na monitor.

      "summary": "This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for\nend-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically\nevaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken\ncurrent turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.\nOur experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full\nspoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of\nsimilar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that\nattention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong\ntrade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed\nanalysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context\nutilization.",

      "title": "On the Representations of Entities in Auto-regressive Large Language\n  Models",
      "summary": "Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,\ngrounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.\nDespite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ninternally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit\nrelationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We\nintroduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how\nLLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can\nbe generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are\nencoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture\nrelational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to\nconsistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations\nderived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,\nextending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring\nnew evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and\nmanipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.\nOur code is avalable at https://github.com/VictorMorand/EntityRepresentations .",
