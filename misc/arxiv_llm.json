      "title": "ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable\n  Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms",
      "summary": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting\ndeployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.",

      "title": "The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in\n  LLMs",
      "summary": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing\nreturns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm\nfor enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet\ncurrent RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and\nentropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven\nExploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense\nof curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from\nboth the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its\ngenerated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates\nfrom a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a\ncalibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM\nfailure modes.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous\ncomputational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the\ncombination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows\nevery token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In\npractice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that\nthis subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers\nacross different models, and works on a variety of input styles.

      "summary": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction\nof multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities\namong specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a\ngrounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically\nfine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them\nwith poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint\nAlignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative\nalignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent\nAlignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences\nthat better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which\nfine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by\nthe agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis\nproves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training\nprocess. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in\ntasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.",

Using over 2.4 million PMC\nopen-access publications (2021-July 2025), we also analysed full texts to\nassess changes in the frequency and co-occurrence of these terms before and\nafter ChatGPT's initial public release. Across databases, delve (+1,500%),\nunderscore (+1,000%), and intricate (+700%) had the largest increases between\n2022 and 2024.

However, as NMP accelerators comprise\ndistributed memory and computation, how to map the MoE computation directly\ndetermines the LLM inference efficiency. Existing parallel mapping strategies,\nincluding Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP), suffer from\neither high communication costs or unbalanced computation utilization, leading\nto inferior efficiency. The dynamic routing mechanism of MoE LLMs further\naggravates the efficiency challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose\nHD-MoE to automatically optimize the MoE parallel computation across an NMP\naccelerator. HD-MoE features an offline automatic hybrid parallel mapping\nalgorithm and an online dynamic scheduling strategy to reduce the communication\ncosts while maximizing the computation utilization. With extensive experimental\nresults, we demonstrate that HD-MoE achieves a speedup ranging from 1.1x to\n1.8x over TP, 1.1x to 1.5x over EP, and 1.0x to 1.4x over the baseline Hybrid\nTP-EP with Compute-Balanced parallelism strategies.",
