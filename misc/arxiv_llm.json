      "summary": "Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to\nassist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is\nthe ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to\nreproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM\nSpeedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the\nNanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.\nEach of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records\ntraining script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from\npseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records\nexecute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse\ncode-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to\nhardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible\nand realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that\nrecent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement\nalready-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our\nbenchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to\nautomate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an\nautonomous research agent.",

Our system is based on a neural network translation\napproach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its\nreal-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences\nwith artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific\nerrors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the\nCzech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error\ngeneration strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,\nand data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert\nfine-tuning scenarios.

      "title": "QuickSilver -- Speeding up LLM Inference through Dynamic Token Halting,\n  KV Skipping, Contextual Token Fusion, and Adaptive Matryoshka Quantization",
      "summary": "Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in\nlarge language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.\nWhile training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime\noptimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive\ndecoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).",

      "summary": "Conversational large-language models are extensively used for issue\nresolution tasks. However, not all developer-LLM conversations are useful for\neffective issue resolution. In this paper, we analyze 686 developer-ChatGPT\nconversations shared within GitHub issue threads to identify characteristics\nthat make these conversations effective for issue resolution. First, we analyze\nthe conversations and their corresponding issues to distinguish helpful from\nunhelpful conversations. We begin by categorizing the types of tasks developers\nseek help with to better understand the scenarios in which ChatGPT is most\neffective. Next, we examine a wide range of conversational, project, and\nissue-related metrics to uncover factors associated with helpful conversations.\nFinally, we identify common deficiencies in unhelpful ChatGPT responses to\nhighlight areas that could inform the design of more effective developer-facing\ntools. We found that only 62% of the ChatGPT conversations were helpful for\nsuccessful issue resolution. ChatGPT is most effective for code generation and\ntools/libraries/APIs recommendations, but struggles with code explanations.\nHelpful conversations tend to be shorter, more readable, and exhibit stronger\nsemantic and linguistic alignment. Larger, more popular projects and more\nexperienced developers benefit more from ChatGPT. At the issue level, ChatGPT\nperforms best on simpler problems with limited developer activity and faster\nresolution, typically well-scoped tasks like compilation errors. The most\ncommon deficiencies in unhelpful ChatGPT responses include incorrect\ninformation and lack of comprehensiveness. Our findings have wide implications\nincluding guiding developers on effective interaction strategies for issue\nresolution, informing the development of tools or frameworks to support optimal\nprompt design, and providing insights on fine-tuning LLMs for issue resolution\ntasks.",

      "summary": "Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in\nunderstanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive\nreasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information\nemerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context\ncan strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines\nASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually\nrelevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with\nstrengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric\nspecifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method\nin enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.",

      "title": "Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling",
      "summary": "Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the\nreasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing\napproaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a\nprincipled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic\nframework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the\nassumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability\ndistribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a\ntheoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target\nperformance level, providing the first principled guidance for\ncompute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop\n\\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the\noptimal number of sampled responses. \\textsc{OptScale} employs a language\nmodel-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the\ndecision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined\nperformance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead\nwhile remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\nOur work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for\nprincipled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient\ndeployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.",

      "summary": "The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\nInformation Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines\nthe importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating\nsuch biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.\nExisting gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,\nleading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.\nBuilding on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel\ngender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to\naddress existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating\nLLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias\nannotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust\nframework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.",

      "summary": "The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a\ntransformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,\nhierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same\npath) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis\nand code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom\nproblems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application\nrequirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental\nstep, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective\nAI-driven telecom management.",

      "summary": "Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important\ntool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from\nLLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether\nentire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source\ntexts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in\nmixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter\nin a mixture model based on \\emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this\nparameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone\nconsistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ\ncontinuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion\nparameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient\nestimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased\nwatermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable\nestimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve\nthese lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source\ntext generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed\nestimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.",

We compare\nour approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,\nevaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,\ndatasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a\nreal-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.\n  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending\non the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on\nwhich it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is\ncomparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly\noutperforming the others.

      "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences\nof patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens\noften outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to\nsubstantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in\npractice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to\nor within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction\napproaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that\ntextual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this\nwork, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms\nof cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of\ntext-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a\ntraining-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual\ntokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on\ntextual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,\nwe treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a\nprogressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and\nlightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual\ninformation to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent\nimprovements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or\ncomplex modifications.

Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on\nthe specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in\nthis particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without\nconsidering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of\nfurther research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the\ndevelopment of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.",
