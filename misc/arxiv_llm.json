      "title": "Crosscoding Through Time: Tracking Emergence & Consolidation Of\n  Linguistic Representations Throughout LLM Pretraining",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during\npretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not\nwell understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as\ntraditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models\nacquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand\nmodel training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and\nalign features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the\nevolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders\nbetween open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and\nrepresentation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects\n(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally\nimportant for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature\nemergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is\narchitecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more\ninterpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout\npretraining.",

      "title": "SpikingBrain Technical Report: Spiking Brain-inspired Large Models",
      "summary": "Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency\nbottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,\nand inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design.",

      "title": "LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for\n  Interactive Complex World Generation",
      "summary": "Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models\nthat simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

Unfortunately, information about the scaling performance and training\nconsiderations of these large training pipelines is scarce in public\nliterature.

Additionally, prior evaluations often cover\nnumerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities\nwithout clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall\nperformance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test\na model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)\nrecognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple\nchoice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language\ndescription). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model\ncomparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art\nlanguage, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)\npopular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time\nseries-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,\nidentifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained\nmultimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still\nhave significant room for improvement.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to\nproduce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual\ncontent remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where\nthe goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task\nalso serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting\nthem to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to\ngenerate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to\nQwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and\nsemantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further\nanalyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of\nobjects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve\nscene coherence.

Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,\ndo not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of\nagentic LLMs.\n  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a\ntriadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive\n(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful\nreasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,\nevaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.\n  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution\nand dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them\nwithin the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability\nthrough case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,\nshowing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and\nstakeholder roles.\n  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,\nTAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,\nsupporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of\nagentic AI.",

Prior\nKV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor\nlayouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute\nkernels.\n  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on\nattention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates\nattention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens\nindependently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform\ncache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation\nmechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more\ncapacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant\nmemory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior\nstructured and semi-structured methods.

      "summary": "The inherent non-stationarity of financial markets and the complexity of\nmulti-modal information pose significant challenges to existing quantitative\ntrading models. Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal\ndata struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model\n(LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from\nstatic strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment\nand fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose\nMM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on\nlarge language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception\nfrom strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in\nnon-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart\npatterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights;\n(2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout,\npositioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3)\nproposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the\nrouter's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks,\nfutures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly\noutperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep\nreinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio,\nand maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert\nbehavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.",

In contrast, demotivators such as challenges\nin evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded\nno hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical\nvalidation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes,\nhighlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a\ncomprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE\neducation.",
