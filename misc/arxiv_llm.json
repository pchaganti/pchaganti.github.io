      "title": "Parallel-R1: Towards Parallel Thinking via Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning\npaths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training\nremains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced\nimitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we\npropose \\textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework\nthat enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning\ntasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses\nthe cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT\non prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel\nthinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on\nharder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,\nand AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,\nleading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model\ntrained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear\nshift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel\nthinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same\ncapability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate\nparallel thinking as a \\textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this\ntemporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,\nyielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and\ncode will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.",

It\naddresses critical limitations in OpenAI's benchmark, including noisy and\nincorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. SimpleQA Verified\nwas created through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving\nde-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce a more\nreliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the\nautorater prompt. On this new benchmark, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves a\nstate-of-the-art F1-score of 55.6, outperforming other frontier models,\nincluding GPT-5.

      "summary": "Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability\nfor modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited\nin scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered\ntable images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,\nopen-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance\nvisual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,\nscalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating\nacross distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA\ncomprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k\nreasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To\npromote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model\ncollaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and\nLLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models\nelaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual\nstructures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on\nVisual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming\nseveral proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature.

      "title": "ImportSnare: Directed \"Code Manual\" Hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented\n  Code Generation",
      "summary": "Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language\nModels(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all\nskill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic\noften results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in\ngenerated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual\ndebugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness\nand security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces\nnew attack surfaces.\n  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency\nhijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden\nmalicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting\ndual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM\nsuggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel\nattack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam\nsearch optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in\nretrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate\njailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious\ndependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and\nJavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for\npopular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able\nto succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both\ncustom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply\nchain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security\nalignment for code generation tasks.

      "title": "Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured\n  Attack Trees",
      "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in\nautomating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of\nfaster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.\nExisting LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided\nreasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a\nresult, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting\nunused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior\ntactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration\ntesting LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the\nMITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the\nLLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries. This suggests that\nincorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments",

      "summary": "Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing\nattention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)\nComparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to\nmodels based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison\nbetween (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks.

      "summary": "The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both\nnon-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While\nthe intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty\nin human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely\nassumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.\nThis raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to\ninstruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered\nproblematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness\ncorrectly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we\nsystematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and\nidentical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the\nquestion of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To\nstudy this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification\ntasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans\nand LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt\nmodifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative\nlabel sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is\nless affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of\nLLMs.",

However, this paradigm is hindered by representation\nmisalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds\nconvey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits\nboth input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments\nshow that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and\n+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains\nacross 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.",
