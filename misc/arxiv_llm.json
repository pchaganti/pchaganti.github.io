      "title": "Zero-Shot Vision Encoder Grafting via LLM Surrogates",
      "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder\nwith a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the\nprimary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential\npromising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language\nmodel before transferring it to the large one. We construct small \"surrogate\nmodels\" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the\nlarge target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders\ntrained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model,\na process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the\nfull-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair\nand, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with\nthe target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall\nVLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.",

      "title": "AutoL2S: Auto Long-Short Reasoning for Efficient Large Language Models",
      "summary": "The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong\nperformance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking,\ngenerating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy\nreasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent\napproaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply\nlong or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length\ndynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto\nLong-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that\nenables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on\nthe complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,\nin which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when\nshorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed\nmethod, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>\ntoken. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating\nlengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'\nability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after\ntraining. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of\nreasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM\nreasoning.",

      "summary": "The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on\nstatic benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined\ntest sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2)\nstandardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained\nassessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To\novercome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation\nframework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the\ninteractive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly\nintegrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning\nassessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five\nvertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology,\nand education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in\nterms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared\nto conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in\ninterpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.",

In contrast, current Large Language\nModels (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D\nenvironments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of\nproper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first\nintroduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000\ntrajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning,\ndesigned to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D\nenvironments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management\nand fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs.\nOur model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as\nqueries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal\nfeatures from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions.\nOur approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while\nmaintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments.\nExperimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by\n16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied\ntasks.",

      "title": "Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for\n  Large-language Model Agents",
      "summary": "Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong\noutputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully\nprevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to\nquantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this\ntraditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and\ninteractive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user,\nand that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel\nscenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose\ntheir meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel\nresearch directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer\ninteractions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide\nall information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning,\nto ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current\ncontext, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech\nspace to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these\nnew ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent\ninteractions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.",

      "summary": "Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning\nthrough reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be\naccurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast,\nour research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical\nconsideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs\nusing reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to\nsubstantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward\nfunction's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve\nrapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%,\ncompared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless\nrewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning\nphrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need\nto''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak\ndownstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models\ntrained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing\nthe importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR\nwith noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models,\nmitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on\nopen-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models'\nfoundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights\nfor advancing post-training techniques.

      "title": "On Learning Verifiers for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning",
      "summary": "Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving\ncomplex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track\nthrough incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning,\nwhich can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this\nissue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex\nproblems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem\nstatement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider\nthe problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language\nChain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step\nsolution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the\nreasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work\nwe give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose\nand analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of\nstrength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for\nlearning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and\nimpossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives\nwithout additional assumptions.",

      "summary": "While the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied in\nboth Simplified and Traditional Chinese, it is yet unclear whether LLMs exhibit\ndifferential performance when prompted in these two variants of written\nChinese. This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM\nresponses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different\ncultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can\nexacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such\nas education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).",

      "summary": "A common approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason is to\ntrain on chain-of-thought (CoT) traces of in-distribution reasoning problems,\nbut such annotated data is costly to obtain for every problem of interest. We\nwant reasoning models to generalize beyond their training distribution, and\nideally to generalize compositionally: combine atomic reasoning skills to solve\nharder, unseen reasoning tasks. We take a step towards compositional\ngeneralization of reasoning skills when addressing a target compositional task\nthat has no labeled CoT data. We find that simply training models on CoT data\nof atomic tasks leads to limited generalization, but minimally modifying CoT\nformats of constituent atomic tasks to be composable can lead to improvements.\nWe can train \"atomic CoT\" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data\nand combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot\nperformance on the target compositional task. Such a combined model can be\nfurther bootstrapped on a small amount of compositional data using rejection\nsampling fine-tuning (RFT). Results on string operations and natural language\nskill compositions show that training LLMs on Composable CoT outperforms\nmultitask learning and continued fine-tuning baselines within a given training\ndata budget.",

      "summary": "The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has\nbeen accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots\nthat reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often\nerroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors\nexhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context\nhallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their\npredictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from\na structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization,\nin which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the\nquery or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability\nexperiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation\ntypes reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal\ncomputations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower\nlayers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii)\nfeature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing\ndirect query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose\nrelative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more\nnuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based\ntraining, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in\nunreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.",

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism\ntailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with\nnegligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of\ngeneration quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token\ndependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we\npropose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes\ntokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and\nmaintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models\nacross multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \\textbf{27.6$\\times$\nthroughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap\nwith autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of\nDiffusion LLMs.",

      "title": "The Entropy Mechanism of Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Language\n  Models",
      "summary": "This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with\nLLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently\nobserved across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy\nentropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished\nexploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy\nperformance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b\nbetween entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly\nindicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus\nbottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,\nR=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration\ntoward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics\nboth theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change\nin policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and\nthe change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy\nGradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance\nterm and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical\nconclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout\ntraining, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.\nThrough understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to\ncontrol entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.\nSpecifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov\nand KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances\nrespectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus\nhelping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream\nperformance.",

This paper presents\nSelf-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses\nand synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we\nexplore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to\npinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on\nthe instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering\nthese keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for\neach identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which\nsynthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new\ndata is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the\nmost effective examples are kept.

Instead of retrieving negative\npages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page.

      "title": "Do Large Language Models Think Like the Brain? Sentence-Level Evidence\n  from fMRI and Hierarchical Embeddings",
      "summary": "Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain\nconverge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and\nimportant question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns\nobserved in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper\nalignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study\nfocuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models,\nsystematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align\nwith the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By\ncomparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI\ndata collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative\nstory, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely\nidentify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region\nactivations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the\nevolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies,\nparticularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at\nhigher semantic abstraction levels.",
