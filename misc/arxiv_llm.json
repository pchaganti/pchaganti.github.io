      "title": "Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large\n  Language Models",
      "summary": "We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for\ndiffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference\ntrajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different\narchitectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances\ntraining stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex\nmath and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific\nmodels to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing\nTraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,\nnamely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still\nconsistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.\nTraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first\nlong-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%\nrelative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical\napplications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,\ntraining, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The\nframework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for\nboth inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of\nvarious supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and\ngeneral tasks.

      "title": "Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the\nreasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe\nefficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common\npractice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this\ndecoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby\nconstraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for\nlearning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate\nbetter cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT\nobjective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how\nto guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs\nRL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level\nexplicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint\nSFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and\nachieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.",

      "title": "Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving\nthe reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these\ncontributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning\nwithout sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.",

      "title": "Staying in the Sweet Spot: Responsive Reasoning Evolution via\n  Capability-Adaptive Hint Scaffolding",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration\ninefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the\nmodel's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems\nare overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are\ntoo simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by\nquantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR\nframework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the\nhigh-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint\n(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous\nhint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint\nlength for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the\noptimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In\neach round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs\ncollected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next\nround. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem\ndifficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration\nefficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5\npoints, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided\napproach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.",

A large research body is\ndedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,\nand educational perspectives.

This study introduces a\nnovel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)\nClaude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which\ncontain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world\ndata distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs\nwere analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with\ntheir performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,\nrecall, MCC, and ROC AUC.

We propose\n\\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that\nenforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty.",

      "summary": "Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions\nand selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for\nimproving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While\nmost prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to\naggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this\nwork, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a\nset of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,\nand synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from\nverifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard\ntraining examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover\nminority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.\nEmpirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and\nreward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes\neffectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than\ncontained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens\nthan majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion\ndynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic\nbiases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such\nbiases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an\nagreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an\nanchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to\nmulti-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge\nto a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time,\nand the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an\nLLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation)\nand demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing\nstark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them\nto human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and\npitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.",

Within\nexperimental particle physics, such structured knowledge bases could expedite\nmethodological and editorial review. Complementarily, within the broader\nscientific community, generative LLM systems grounded in published work could\nmake for reliable companions allowing non-experts to analyze open-access data.\nTechniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) rely on semantically\nmatching localized text chunks, but struggle to maintain coherent context when\nrelevant information spans multiple segments, leading to a fragmented\nrepresentation devoid of global cross-document information. Here, we utilize\nthe hierarchical organization of experimental physics articles to build a tree\nrepresentation of the corpus, and present the SciTreeRAG system that uses this\nstructure to create contexts that are more focused and contextually rich than\nstandard RAG. Additionally, we develop methods for using LLMs to transform the\nunstructured corpus into a structured knowledge graph representation. We then\nimplement SciGraphRAG, a retrieval system that leverages this knowledge graph\nto access global cross-document relationships eluding standard RAG, thereby\nencapsulating domain-specific connections and expertise.

      "summary": "We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of\nlong-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to\nidentify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that\ncurrently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that\nthey often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,\nand are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match\nthe agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,\nprobe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems\nover long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation\narchitecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.\nSpecifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using\na central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized\nEvaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of\nthe reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%).

Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,\nidentifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard\nand trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that\nclassification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic\nambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component\nidentification than on interpretive maintenance actions.

Although extensive\nmethods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,\nrejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents\na key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and\nsecurity, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we\npropose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically\nallocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions\nof security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial\npotential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy\nand performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved\nMoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and\nhidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly\nclassifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during\nrouter optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation.

      "summary": "Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective\npost-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise\nLLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,\nraising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our\nobservation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we\nintroduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and\nbroaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an\nenhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,\nand LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks\nposed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong\nbaselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.\nCrucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the\nr-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration\nof LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety\nresearch.",

Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,\nutilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to\ntargeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with\ndomain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus\nreasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and\ntrack turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement\nacross turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and\ntasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in\nmath late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,\nvague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts\nreliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;\nspeed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and\ndrives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation\nmoves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little\nsemantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,\nelaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration\nmeasurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or\nswitch strategies.",
