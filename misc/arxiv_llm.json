      "summary": "Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without\nsafety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely\nused by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment\nevaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs\nsimilar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require\nfurther attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such\nmodels are not available to the research community.\n  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx\nresponds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving\nthe base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It\nprovides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,\nevaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in\nlanguage model safety.",

      "summary": "Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing,\nhindering decision quality. While large language models (LLMs) have been widely\nstudied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users,\npotentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a\npre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281\nfive-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city\nfor a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions:\nno facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human\nfacilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation\nincreases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level\nof engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at\nlimited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group,\nor their facilitator. Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of\nfacilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial\nbut partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the\nhidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based\ninterfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release\nour experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an\nopen-source tool.",

To address this\nchallenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark\nbased on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the\nmodel responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.\nSpecifically designed for settings without standard references, our method\nadopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation\nusing expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention\nprinciples. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety\ndimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.\nAdditionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language\ndataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,\nderived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show\nthat our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and\nproduces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing\napproaches.

      "summary": "We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python\ncode in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness.

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose\nsystems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without\nextensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires\nintegrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,\nstructured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist\nmultimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates\nits zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based\nquestion answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified\nprotocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20\nagainst standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU\nmedical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that\nGPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in\nmultimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in\nmost dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to\nintegrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,\nrecommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on\nthese controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from\nhuman-comparable to above human-expert performance.

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent\nresearch area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both\nalgorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,\nseveral critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized\nguidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their\nunderlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,\nvariations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led\nto conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these\ntechniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting\nappropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL\ntechniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a\nunified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable\nscenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained\nexperiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and\narchitectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for\nselecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable\nroadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we\nreveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning\ncapability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results\ndemonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,\nsurpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.",

However, existing methods compromise text quality,\nrequire white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations\nexclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a\ngeneral framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized\nmessages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without\naltering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on\ndeterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose\nfeature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally\ngeneralizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through\nsampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees\nrelating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any\nsuitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection\naccuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's\nconsistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection\naccuracy.

While many of the existing\npapers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to\nevaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this\nwork, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using\nboth established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they\nalign with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model\ncalibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment\nto human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer\npreference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence\nof model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and\ndistributional analysis.",

      "summary": "A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of\nlarge-scale AI models that make \"moral\" judgments. Much of this literature\nfocuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought\nexperiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the\nmost immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called\nstreet-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social\nresources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how\nprinciples of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization\nmechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments\nalign with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined\nvulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness\nresource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services\n(maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to\nperform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely\ninconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different\nLLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time,\nLLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise\ntesting. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI\nsystems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.",

In contrast, programmers working\nin languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,\nwhich enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent\ncomplexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of\nexisting transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the\napplicability of formal verification to Python programs.\n  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed\nby bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated\nC code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code\nusing existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two\nPython benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high\ndegree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development\nenvironment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault\ndiagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling\nlarge language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent\nadvances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nallows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more\ninformed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge\nduring policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in\nunproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as \"dead ends\", committing to\noverconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and\nundermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose\nREX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while\nmaintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional\ncorrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling\nStrategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts\nto escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs\nimportance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,\nthereby mitigating gradient estimation bias.

In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to\nproduce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a\nmathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by\noff-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions\noften leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the\nnumerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established\noptimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema\nwith an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative\nrepair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the\nunit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces\noptimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.\nResults demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation\nsignificantly enhances solution reliability.

By incorporating only a few input-output examples into\nprompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks.

To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a\ndiversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in\nbiomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:\nFirst, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by\noptimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for\nunlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to\nselect the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three\nbiomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),\nand text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along\nwith three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently\noutperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while\ndemonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance.

In this work, we\ninvestigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether\nLLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability\nestimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of\ninternal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and\naggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level\nreliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,\nwe find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and\nmodel confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect\nresponses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our\nprobing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the\ndetection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results\nunderscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the\npotential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.",

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

      "summary": "Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on\npre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural\ndriver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the\npotential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous,\nmulti-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a\nmotion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent,\nPre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable.\nResults showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable\ndriving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower\nvariability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane\ndeviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the\nChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence,\nanimacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent.\nOur thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse\ninteraction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions,\nentertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight\nthe potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance\ndriving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.",
