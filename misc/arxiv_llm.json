      "title": "CodePDE: An Inference Framework for LLM-driven PDE Solver Generation",
      "summary": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical\nsystems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical\nsolvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally\nexpensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets\nand often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code\ngeneration task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for\ngenerating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced\ninference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical\ncapacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and\ntest-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves\nsuperhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also\npresent a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing\ntheir accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings\nhighlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,\noffering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model\ndevelopment.

      "summary": "Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in\nmultivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive.\nTechniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce\ntheir sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning\nmethod, SPAT ($\\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\\textbf{P}$runer for\n$\\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms\nand yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT\naims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of\noverfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We\npropose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\\textbf{S}$ensitivity\n$\\textbf{E}$nhanced $\\textbf{N}$ormalized $\\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that\nmeasures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase.\nExperiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models\nachieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs.\nFurthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based\nand LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference,\nhighlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention\nmechanisms.

      "title": "AC-Reason: Towards Theory-Guided Actual Causality Reasoning with Large\n  Language Models",
      "summary": "Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is\nresponsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world\nscenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC\ntheory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason,\na semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events\nwithin an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g.,\nsufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a\ntheory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly\nconstruct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal\nstructure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation,\nwe introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending\nBig-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully\nannotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on\nactual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench\npresent greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and\nAC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over\nbaselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy\nof 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 +\nAC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further\nenables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only\nQwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful\nreasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation\nstudy proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the\nproposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.",

      "summary": "To advance the mathematical proficiency of large language models (LLMs), the\nDeepMath team has launched an open-source initiative aimed at developing an\nopen mathematical LLM and systematically evaluating its mathematical\ncreativity. This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative.\nWhile recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized\nreasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to\nundergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these\nmodels have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets\nremain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for\nmathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality\nbenchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis,\nand other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs'\ncreative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results\nshow that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution\ncomponents and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps,\nincomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing\nmodel, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic\nundergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more\ncomplex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for\nopen problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a\ndegree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems,\nsuch performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized\npatterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.",

      "summary": "Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability\ndistributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove\nformally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence\nperplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward,\nor arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled\nprotocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that\nprior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological\nflaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted\norders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical\ninvariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating\nfrom both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely)\nagreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in\nself-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our\ntheoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding\npositional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs'\nprobability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.",

      "summary": "This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment,\nconsisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing\ncodes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. The\nbenchmark comprises 1,100 real-world nursing behavior instances collected\nthrough a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying\ntiers. These instances are annotated by five clinical nurses and then augmented\nwith LLM-generated counterfactuals with reversed ethic polarity. Each original\ncase is paired with a value-aligned and a value-violating version, resulting in\n2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset. To increase\nadversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a\ndialogue-based format that embeds contextual cues and subtle misleading\nsignals, yielding a Hard-Level dataset. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nLLMs on their alignment with nursing values. Our findings reveal three key\ninsights: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest performance on the Easy-Level\ndataset (94.55), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms other models on the\nHard-Level dataset (89.43), significantly surpassing the medical LLMs; (2)\nJustice is consistently the most difficult nursing value dimension to evaluate;\nand (3) in-context learning significantly improves alignment.

This\ncapability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces\nnovel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is\nintegrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has\nbecome a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG\npipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data\nstorage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then\npaired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second\nstep, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security\nconsiderations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards,\nand best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of\nrobust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.",

      "summary": "We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data\nscaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize\nthis insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)\nobjective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization\nproblem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction\nperformance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle\nduring LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient\nalignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of\nrepresentation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive\ntrade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation\nbetween awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively\nswitches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2\npretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves\ncross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining\ntask on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate\ncatastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and\nseparating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -\nparalleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.",

      "title": "PWC-MoE: Privacy-Aware Wireless Collaborative Mixture of Experts",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud servers alleviate the\ncomputational and storage burdens on local devices but raise privacy concerns\ndue to sensitive data transmission and require substantial communication\nbandwidth, which is challenging in constrained environments. In contrast, small\nlanguage models (SLMs) running locally enhance privacy but suffer from limited\nperformance on complex tasks. To balance computational cost, performance, and\nprivacy protection under bandwidth constraints, we propose a privacy-aware\nwireless collaborative mixture of experts (PWC-MoE) framework. Specifically,\nPWC-MoE employs a sparse privacy-aware gating network to dynamically route\nsensitive tokens to privacy experts located on local clients, while\nnon-sensitive tokens are routed to non-privacy experts located at the remote\nbase station. To achieve computational efficiency, the gating network ensures\nthat each token is dynamically routed to and processed by only one expert. To\nenhance scalability and prevent overloading of specific experts, we introduce a\ngroup-wise load-balancing mechanism for the gating network that evenly\ndistributes sensitive tokens among privacy experts and non-sensitive tokens\namong non-privacy experts. To adapt to bandwidth constraints while preserving\nmodel performance, we propose a bandwidth-adaptive and importance-aware token\noffloading scheme. This scheme incorporates an importance predictor to evaluate\nthe importance scores of non-sensitive tokens, prioritizing the most important\ntokens for transmission to the base station based on their predicted importance\nand the available bandwidth. Experiments demonstrate that the PWC-MoE framework\neffectively preserves privacy and maintains high performance even in\nbandwidth-constrained environments, offering a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-limited scenarios.",

Although large language\nmodels (LLMs) offer potential solutions, their schema hallucination tendencies\nand context window limitations pose challenges for practical deployment. In\nresponse, we propose Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction (ASEE), a novel\nparadigm combining schema paraphrasing with schema retrieval-augmented\ngeneration. ASEE adeptly retrieves paraphrased schemas and accurately generates\ntargeted structures. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct the\nMulti-Dimensional Schema-aware Event Extraction (MD-SEE) benchmark, which\nsystematically consolidates 12 datasets across diverse domains, complexity\nlevels, and language settings.
