      "title": "A Dataset for Distilling Knowledge Priors from Literature for\n  Therapeutic Design",
      "summary": "AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new\ntherapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design\nspaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental\npriors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models\non the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\\% of molecules\nproposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.",

      "title": "STream3R: Scalable Sequential 3D Reconstruction with Causal Transformer",
      "summary": "We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates\npointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on\nexpensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that\nscale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an\nstreaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal\nattention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning\ngeometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to\ndiverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional\nmethods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently\noutperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.\nMoreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training\ninfrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for\nvarious downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal\nTransformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D\nunderstanding in streaming environments.

      "title": "Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation",
      "summary": "The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a\ncritical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in\nmulti-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",

To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs\nvia structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we\nintroduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability\nthrough format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively\nrefine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to\nexternal tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy\nmodels provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL\ntraining, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust\nsim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world\nknowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL\ndemonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce\nhallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search\nengines without additional effort.

In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and\nGPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor\nSegmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain\nmetastases (MET).

Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest\nmacro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),\nand GPT-5-nano (35.85%).

Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first\nChinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological\nexpertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.\nSpecifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces\nover 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,\ngenerated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative\nprompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.\nSubsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples\nare identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative\npolicy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining\ndata is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response\ngeneration and psychological domain knowledge.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making\nagents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,\ncomputationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller\nmodels, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn\ninteractions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.\nTo address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization\n(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal\nText-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)\nframeworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative\nepisode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm\nwith a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show\nimproves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a\n3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our\npost-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on\nthe Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a\npractical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating\nsequential decision-making agents using LLMs.",

We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both\ndirect and chain of thought prompting.\n  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform\npoorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,\noutput inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating\na systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.\n  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:\ncurrent LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the\nstructured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably\n(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating\ncounterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this\ndissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for\nprobing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.",

While prior research has primarily focused on identifying\nwhether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content\ninfluences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content.

To\ninvestigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model\n(i.e., $\\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its\nexploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage\nof Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process.

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation).

Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting\nstrategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating\nattribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond\nlabels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.",

To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a\nsuite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By\ncombining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B\nlowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a\nnew class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.",
