      "title": "SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs",
      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending\npre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%\nmemory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on\nefficiency test.

      "title": "Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression",
      "summary": "Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by\ngenerating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,\ngeneration cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather\nthan the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time\nhyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within\nthe same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.\nThe success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression\nmethods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For\ninstance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on\nGPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.",

      "title": "Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity\n  Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets",
      "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their\nvulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to\ndownstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance\nof upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and\nreducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer\nactionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.",

      "summary": "Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital\ncontent creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object\ngeneration and layout generation. While recent generative models have\nsignificantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout\ngeneration remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses\nasset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves\nimpressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.",

      "summary": "Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse\ndomains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive\ninterfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack\nthe sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting\ntheir contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a\nlarge multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing\nconditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,\nVideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to\ncondition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.\nAdditionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for\nbidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video\nsequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate\nprecise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module\nto produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language\nmodel but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,\nwe curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated\nwith 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we\nintroduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five\nreal-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,\nVideo-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring\nVideo Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks.

      "summary": "Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,\nanalyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in\nscale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,\nfact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are\ninfluenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not\ndirectly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and\nactual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does\nnot degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,\nthe quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on\nthe model's parametric knowledge.

      "summary": "Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress\nin video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of\nwell-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs\nunderexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale\nhour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around\n9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60\nminutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,\nspanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,\nscene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,\nVideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and\nsupports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video\ncomprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and\nefficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables\nhour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory\naugmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and\nspatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context.

      "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to\nmultimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for\nimage input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.\nHowever, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on\ncoarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders\non math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual\nmodification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical\nINterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively\ninterleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an\nInterleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within\nmath figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,\ncontaining 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual\nregions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.\nWe further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively\ncombining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which\nderives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in\nmathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by\n+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively.

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning\nlarge language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning\ncapabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and\nexisting work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL\nfine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We\nintroduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,\nprioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield\ninformative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we\ndevelop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small\nreference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions\nis then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce\nrollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent\nrollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.\nExtensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method\nreduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of\nperformance as the original GRPO algorithm.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly\nface the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.\nExisting unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a\nregularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.\nThis often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained\ndata, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of\nLLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced\nvia a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output\ndistribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is\npreserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to\nentropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and\nmaintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust\noptimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual\nalgorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through\nthe dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks\nacross diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently\nmatches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted\ninformation while preserving downstream utility.",

      "title": "Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia\n  Games",
      "summary": "LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user\nand a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world\nsettings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team\nmeetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the\ndecision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision\nmaking. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in\naddition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate\nour agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both\nhuman participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent\nperforms on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its\nability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the\nagent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,\nalthough differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and\ncode to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous\ncommunication between LLM agents.

TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving.

However, the\nlikelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta\n(y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training,\ninadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this\npaper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,\nshowing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video\ncontent. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain\nhigh-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus\nmitigating the unintended drop.

Since entailment classification\nis a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from\ngenerating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit\n``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding\nsuch models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one\nthat both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the\nsource for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and\naccurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,\nwe define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,\n(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated\nclassification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved\nhallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an\nanalysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the\nintermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for\nthe improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.",

      "title": "SECNEURON: Reliable and Flexible Abuse Control in Local LLMs via Hybrid\n  Neuron Encryption",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being\ndeployed in local environments, presenting significant security and\ncontrollability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the\ndirect control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse.\nExisting mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are\nfrequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We\npropose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access\ncontrol within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable,\ncost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.\nSECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to\ndynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting\nunauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a\ntask-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons\nand construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then\nintroduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of\nneurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron\ndetection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially\ndecrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and\nCollusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.\nExperiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized\ntask accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%.\nUsing an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related\nmalicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates\nunauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and\nmembership inference to random guesses.",
