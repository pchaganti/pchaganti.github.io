      "title": "KnowTrace: Bootstrapping Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation with\n  Structured Knowledge Tracing",
      "summary": "Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to\nhandle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between\nLLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's\ncontext. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing\nburden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,\nwith futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this\npaper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the\ncontext overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead\nof simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out\ndesired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to\nthe input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with\nan intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective\nmechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as\nprocess supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show\nthat KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop\nquestion answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies\nthe gains.",

      "title": "On Path to Multimodal Historical Reasoning: HistBench and HistAgent",
      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable\nprogress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly\nhistory, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for\nAI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and\ncross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many\nexisting benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage\nwith historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce\nHistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate\nAI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert\ncontributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual\nretrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and\nimages, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or\ncultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and\nmodern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world\nregions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we\nfurther present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully\ndesigned tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding\nin History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of\n27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online\nsearch and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)\nand Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These\nresults highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and\ndemonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.",

      "summary": "Solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) (e.g., traveling\nsalesman problems (TSPs) and capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs)) in\npractice traditionally involves handcrafting heuristics or specifying a search\nspace for finding effective heuristics. The main challenges from these\napproaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and\nimplementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant\nprogress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined\ngeneralized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and\nguided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori\ninformation on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP\nand CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield\nimpressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still\nrequire considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nend-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic\ndesign methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD\nemploys LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP\nat hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based\nheuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving\nthe transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our\nexperimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of\ndesigning heuristics with competitive or improved results over the\nstate-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.",

      "summary": "Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models\n(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process\nReward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning\nsteps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning\ncovers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting\ndistribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to\ngreater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,\ntherefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.\nHowever, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality\nimbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an\neffective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce\nDreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which\nemploys bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM\nperforms fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM\nto prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of\ndataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is\nevaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain\nweights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the\ngeneralization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple\nmultimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general\nreasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the\nperformance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that\nDreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods\nand yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.",

      "summary": "Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and\ntrustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized\nuncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,\nhas emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language\nmodels (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)\nremains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,\nfour task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that\ncurrent VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and\nsettings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)\nconsistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific\nreasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address\ncalibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a\ntwo-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal\nsettings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs\nacross modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental\nimportance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable\nmultimodal systems.",

      "summary": "Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular,\nwith impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.\nThese models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often\nresults in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce\ntheir robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve\nrobustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models\nbecause they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the\nmodel's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve\nthe robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not\nrequire access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on\nthe complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling\nmore challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For\nless complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with\nLLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%.

      "title": "Exploring Generative Error Correction for Dysarthric Speech Recognition",
      "summary": "Despite the remarkable progress in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR) engines, accurately transcribing dysarthric speech remains a major\nchallenge. In this work, we proposed a two-stage framework for the Speech\nAccessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines\ncutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error\ncorrection (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and\ntraining strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve\ntranscription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset\ndemonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech,\nwhile highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive\nanalysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and\nlinguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition",
