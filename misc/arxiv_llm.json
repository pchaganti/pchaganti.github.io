      "title": "CodePlot-CoT: Mathematical Visual Reasoning by Thinking with Code-Driven\n  Images",
      "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they\nstill face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,\nsuch as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.\nMost LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while\nmultimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack\nthe necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our\nwork opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides\nthe community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and\nstrong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our\ndatasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.",

      "title": "Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Agentic Reasoning",
      "summary": "Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also\neffectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design\nprinciples and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning\nin agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and\nreasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic\ntrajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger\nSFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration\nand markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are\ncrucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and\nmaintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.\n(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool\ncalls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.\nTogether, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and\ntraining efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with\nsmaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL\nresearch. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a\nhigh-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL\ndataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the\nagentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including\nAIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,\n4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance\ncompared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:\nhttps://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL",

      "title": "QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning\n  for LLMs",
      "summary": "We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for\nlarge language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning\ncapabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and\nlong rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4\nquantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL\nwhile reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that\nquantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and\nenabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize\nexploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that\nQeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is\nthe first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB\nGPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster\nreward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while\nmatching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical\nbenchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model.

To address these gaps, we introduce\nAgent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for\nevaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates\nverified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures\nwithin a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison\nunder real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a\nsingle-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk\nstyles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them\nacross GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and\nGemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets\ndemonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral\npatterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,\nwhereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus\nestablishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving\nevaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.",

Existing\nbenchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately\nassess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\nPACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles\nof realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber\ndefenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a\ngeneralized cyber offense threat.

However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the\nrole of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.\nIn this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from\na simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to\nanalyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and\noptimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap\nthe code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation\nevaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these\ntools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical\nresults show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute\nmargin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the\ngeneralization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their\nsymbolic accuracy.

      "title": "MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model",
      "summary": "With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.\nHowever, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical\nlimitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\\texttt{pass@1024}$), many\nexisting base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math\nbenchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL\nfine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen\nexisting solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such\nsharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster\nexploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we\nintroduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat\ncommon open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling\nbudgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that\nlearn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated\nsampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and\nDeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school\nmath. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as\nNemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform\npoorly on MATH-B at $\\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall\nshort on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze\nexploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We\nrelease MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.",

However, existing evaluations\nfocus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing\nmulti-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the\nfield without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,\nwe introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs\nand agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50\nexpert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,\nincluding computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All\nquestions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo\nrigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and\nanswerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and\nagents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the\ncutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher\nscores, none exceeded 40 points.

These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and\napply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.\nTo address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge\nDistillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to\nthe real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic\nmodules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven\nAdaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation\nfocus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating\ncomputational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.\nSecond, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a\ncounterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low\ntemperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high\ntemperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's\ncomplete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization.

This motivates\ndeveloping internalization methods that embed policy documents into model\npriors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets\ngeneric prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels\nand require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce\nCC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four\nlevels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity\nand offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization.
