      "title": "Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage\nLLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language\ninteractions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world\nhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,\nread cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code\nevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,\noverlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even\nthe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit\nclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional\ncorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with human\npreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on\nreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe\ncheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that\nbetter align with user preferences in coding.",

      "title": "h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance\ndrops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this\nrely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of\nwhich scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon\ndata. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,\nmulti-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data\nusing outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in\ncomplexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.\nEmpirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on\ncomposed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,\ncompetition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.\nImportantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than\nbaselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning\npaths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards\nachieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon\ntraining, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1\ntherefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon\nproblems using only existing data.",

We\nintroduce CORGI, a new benchmark specifically designed for real-world business\ncontexts. CORGI is composed of synthetic databases inspired by enterprises such\nas Doordash, Airbnb, and Lululemon. It provides questions across four\nincreasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory,\npredictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning,\ntemporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and\nmulti-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on\nhigh-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer\nactionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about\n21\\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between\npopular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a\npublic dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions.",

      "summary": "While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating\nmachine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE\ntraining data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from\nlow scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually\ncurated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We\nintroduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw\ndatasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient\ngenerate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,\nreal-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in\nMLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled\nwith a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and\nhigh-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and\nreal-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of\nreal-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,\nobjectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively\nacross a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks\nshows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on\nMLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully\nhuman-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to\nscaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.",

      "summary": "Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language\nmodels (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention\n($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio\nbenchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in\nrealistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce\nAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and\ninference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set\nof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations\nranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of\n2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,\nsound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio\nlength grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs\nof token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across\ncurrent LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and\nmemory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio\nand multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding\nmodels capable of solving complex audio tasks.",

      "title": "On the Convergence of Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when\ninstructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper\ndemonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it\nexhibits a desirable property of converged performance.",

      "summary": "Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers\nwhere verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide\ncoarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based\nrewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing\napproaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such\nstatic rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and\nfail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce\nOnline Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates\nevaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of\nresponses from current and reference policies. This online process enables\ncontinuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.\nEmpirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over\ntraining exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as\nwell as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively\nanalyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as\ntransparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.",

Unlike\nexisting datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers\n164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with\ndiverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The\ndataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X\nmotion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning\nand evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we\npresent Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple\nbaseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,\norchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker\ngesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis\nof coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video\ngeneration module.

This is where existing evaluation methods\ncurrently fail and exhibit considerable variability.\n  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into\n'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce\na novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers\nevaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety\nof baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset\n(LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human\nexpert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d)\nwe open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our\nexperiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and\nadvance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal\nquestion-answering.",

      "summary": "Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly\nrelies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1\ncorrectness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many\ntasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers\nunder-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.\nReward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a\ncomplementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show\nthat hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging\nthe nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.",

      "summary": "Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not\nonly over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and\ncross-page dependencies. However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing\nstructural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at\ninference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This\noften results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for\nmulti-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a\nnovel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs\na symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page\ndependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more\nholistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent\ndynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively\nretrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on\nMMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG\nimproves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any\ntop-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at\ncomparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.",
