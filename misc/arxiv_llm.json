      "title": "Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for\n  Multimodal LLMs",
      "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic\nunderstanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,\nrequiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object\ninter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms\nin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong\ncapabilities can be easily transferred to videos.",

      "title": "How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?",
      "summary": "Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth\nuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise\nprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.",

      "title": "LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation",
      "summary": "Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle\nto effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and\ncomplex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

      "summary": "Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance.\nWhile recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved\nautomated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of\nincreased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that\ninvolve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose\nEffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy\nwhile balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality\nreasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model,\nDeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each\n(source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and\nfunctionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a\ntwo-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented\nsamples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and\nbalance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation\npairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation\naccuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while\nreducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference\nlatency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the\ncomplementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally,\nEffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into\nagent-based frameworks.

      "summary": "Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with\nindividual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the\nnuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward\nhacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust\nreinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable\npersonalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a\nPersonalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional\nscores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a\nCritique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs\nbased on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a\nrigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms\nstandard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an\naverage 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses\nthe performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to\nfaithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.",

      "summary": "People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,\nincluding their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to\nmeaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts\neffectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword\ntokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or\nsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and\nreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,\nrobustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a\nshift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step\ntoward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.",

      "summary": "The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their\ncapacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by\ntraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K\ntokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite\nof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A\nHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput\nwhile preserving model accuracy.

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the\nmainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries\nto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer\npredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

      "summary": "The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77\ntokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform\nfine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment\nloss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation\ninheritance and contrastive tuning.

While a growing body of theoretical work has\nemerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning\nlarge language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise\ncomparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable.

This result\nshows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,\nthe bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,\nwhich was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that\nexplicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.",

      "title": "Fetch.ai: An Architecture for Modern Multi-Agent Systems",
      "summary": "Recent surges in LLM-driven intelligent systems largely overlook decades of\nfoundational multi-agent systems (MAS) research, resulting in frameworks with\ncritical limitations such as centralization and inadequate trust and\ncommunication protocols. This paper introduces the Fetch.ai architecture, an\nindustrial-strength platform designed to bridge this gap by facilitating the\nintegration of classical MAS principles with modern AI capabilities. We present\na novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain\nblockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This\nis complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure,\ninteroperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent\norchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals\ninto complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this\nsystem through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents\ndynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely.\nUltimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving\nbeyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and\neconomically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.",
