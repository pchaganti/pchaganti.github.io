      "title": "Noise Hypernetworks: Amortizing Test-Time Compute in Diffusion Models",
      "summary": "The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision\nmodels, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to\neffectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach\nrecovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time\noptimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

      "title": "Neural Bandit Based Optimal LLM Selection for a Pipeline of Tasks",
      "summary": "With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety\nof tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict\nwhich out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm\nthat trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online\nmanner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,\neven in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on\ntelecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM\nselection algorithms.",

For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that\nmaximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We\nevaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across\nfour reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using\n260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of\nOphthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome\nwas multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking\nvia a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a\nreference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of\naccuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x\nstronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).\nCost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto\nfrontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,\nhigh-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality\nophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on\naccuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of\nLLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.",

ICL has recently been explored for\ncomputer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve\nspecialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and\nlimit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable\nDiffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).\nSpecifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the\nself-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly\nincorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any\nadditional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is\nable to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and\ncolorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection\nover union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by\n8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,\nrespectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to\neffectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task\nbetter and further improve the performance.",

      "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into\nreal-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and\nsafety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment\napproaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction\ntuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each\nwith distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified\nevaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these\nparadigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major\nalignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:\nalignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and\nrobustness.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven\neducational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics\neducation. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed\nsolutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable\nand precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study\nfocuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,\nDeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including\narithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning\nerrors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we\nintentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs\nand prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors\nin individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both\nsingle-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the\nreasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly\nperfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors\nrevealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly\nimpacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less\nfrequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall\nperformance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM\nperformance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into\nmathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and\nassessment precision.",

Difficult and ambiguous tasks cannot easily be collapsed into unitary\nlabels. Prior work has shown that deliberation and discussion improve data\nquality and preserve diverse perspectives -- however, synchronous deliberation\nthrough crowdsourcing platforms is time-intensive and costly. In this work, we\ncreate a Socratic dialog system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as a\ndeliberation partner in place of other crowdworkers. Against a benchmark of\nsynchronous deliberation on two tasks (Sarcasm and Relation detection), our\nSocratic LLM encouraged participants to consider alternate annotation\nperspectives, update their labels as needed (with higher confidence), and\nresulted in higher annotation accuracy (for the Relation task where ground\ntruth is available).

While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can\nbe effective context-aided forecasters via na\\\"ive direct prompting, their full\npotential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,\nproviding new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.\nReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing\nus to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its\nforecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts\nwith context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting\npipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided\nforecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the\nlargest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to\nestimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger\nmodels. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from\nthe CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\\\"ive\nprompting across LLMs of different sizes and families.

      "summary": "Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic\nRegression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast\ncross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods\nprimarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring\nexcessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to\ntreating complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and\ngeneralization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs'\nproficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR\ntasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR\ncapability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning\nremains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically\nengineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises 148,102 diverse\nequations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization,\nenabling effective training and inference. Further, SymbArena proposes a\nheuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond\nexisting SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we\nexplore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish\nSymbolicChat, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental\nresults validate SymbolicChat as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical\nmethods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming\nthe second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and\n8.37% in form-level consistency score.",

Recent\nmethods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training\ncombining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some\nmethods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via\nonly distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation\nframework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.\nInspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of\nreinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We\nidentify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher\nmodel. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop\na method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can\nenhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully\ncurated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and\nout-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the\nstudent model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method\nthrough evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and\ncode generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only\n0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling.

Given the easier training and superior\nperformance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video\nVAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs.

To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward\nyet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human\naction. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages\nof two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic\nvideo-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in\nthe model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human\nbehavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that\ncontains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We\ndeveloped ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled\nsamples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show\nthat ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion\nunderstanding, and behavior interpretation.",
