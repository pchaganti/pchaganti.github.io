      "title": "Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning",
      "summary": "Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and\nsolve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as\nnatural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing\nLLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,\ntypically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection\nor augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,\nlimiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose\nMixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three\ncomplementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced\nsymbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases\nand partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT\nadopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns\nfrom filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT\ninference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce\nbetter predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO\nand ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality\nchain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.\nFurther analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and\ninference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning\nproblems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,\nwith truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural\nlanguage inference.",

      "title": "Keep Security! Benchmarking Security Policy Preservation in Large\n  Language Model Contexts Against Indirect Attacks in Question Answering",
      "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive\ndomains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to\nuser-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with\nrespect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on\ngeneral safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for\ncontextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address\nthis, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating\nLLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.\nDerived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and\nqueries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited\ninformation. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant\nvulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive\ninformation. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,\nhighlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive\napplications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the\ncorrect answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints\nduring generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise\noutputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for\nmore robust methods to guarantee contextual security.",

      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in\nspatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual\nReasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object\ntransformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in\ncross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from\ninefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we\npropose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm\nwith a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1\nrewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive\ninaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive\nevaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its\nunique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning.

      "title": "Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by\nother LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as\nLLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also\nvulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit\nthe preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by\na candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them\nby a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal\nprovided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate\ntext preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen\nLLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than\nexisting frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene\ndirectly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also\ndemonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers\nwhen the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not\nused during training. These findings raise important questions about the design\nof more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that\nhuman preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to\noptimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could\nfind future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial\nattacks.",

      "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can\nenhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However,\ncurrent LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to\nhallucinations. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a\nnon-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential\ndriving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can\ndirectly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that\nmaintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for\nsolving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to\npropose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic\nhints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in\nmotion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic\nindications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance.\nBased on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual\nReinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that\nincludes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space.\nContextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic\nweight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache\nModule is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL\nhigh-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong\noverall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3%\nunder diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under\nsafety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision\nrate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex\nscenarios.",

In this\nwork, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs\ndeceptive narratives by \"montaging\" truthful statements without introducing\nexplicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based\nevaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,\nwith AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained\nevaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies\nfactual accuracy and event-order consistency.

      "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous\ntheoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant\nprogress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical\nframeworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified\nmathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM\narchitectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two\nfundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates\nSolomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length\noptimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff\ninduction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for\nin-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our\ntheoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection\nthat prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We\ndemonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that\nthis strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for\nsmaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence\nexamples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and\npractical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable\ninsights for future model development.",

      "title": "Soft Thinking: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of LLMs in Continuous\n  Concept Space",
      "summary": "Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts\nrather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning\nmodels, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human\nlanguage, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in\nthe semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and\nupper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration\nof reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling\none token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free\nmethod that emulates human-like \"soft\" reasoning by generating soft, abstract\nconcept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created\nby the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the\ncontinuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer\nrepresentations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,\neach generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related\ndiscrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge\neffectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse\nmathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points\nwhile simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard\nCoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain\nhighly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking\nto break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

      "title": "Beyond Hard and Soft: Hybrid Context Compression for Balancing Local and\n  Global Information Retention",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in\nlong-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant\nprocessing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing\nmethods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or\nencode context into latent representations for soft global compression.\nHowever, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity\nof demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the\nloss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose\n$\\textbf{Hy}$brid $\\textbf{Co}$ntext $\\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for\nLLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context\ncompression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details\nfor task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global\nsemantics with the global view, based on the observation that different\nadapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer\nthat assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local\nview, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a\nbalanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary\nparaphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This\npromotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant\ninformation while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing\nlocal and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show\nthat our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while\nreducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an\naverage of 13.1\\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,\nHyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token\nconsumption by 88.8\\%.",

Such threats have raised critical concerns\nabout the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While\nexisting defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent\nadvancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods\nto circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense\nframeworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking\nthreats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary\nstudy demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against\na particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack\npattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a\nscalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking.

However, its adoption is hindered by\nlabor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem\nprovers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are\ngenerating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an\nLLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches.

      "title": "Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When\n  Evaluating LLM Defenses",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications\nranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main\napproaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and\njailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even\nagainst Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates\nadversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search\nspace over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding\nsuccessful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to\nlocal minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we\nassess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed\nthreat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment\nprocess. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the\nintermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting\nas a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly\neffective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show\nour informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show\na gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack\nperformance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to\nsuccessfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective\nacross diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,\neffective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,\nthat these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit\nalignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,\nour results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and\nthe need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.",

As MLLMs are\nincreasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become\ncritical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving\nmultilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed\nnature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that\nmemorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to\nfully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating\nlanguages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true\npatterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based\ncorrelation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze\ncross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,\nthose with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend\nthat only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.\nThese findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in\nevaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also\nconstitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains\nMemorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad\nimplications for multilingual NLP.",

Existing safety\nevaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses,\noverlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal\nrepresentations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR),\na listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states\nfrom the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions\nusing intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a\nlightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal\nmodel states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety\nsignals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly\nimproves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon\npublication.",
