      "title": "BrowseMaster: Towards Scalable Web Browsing via Tool-Augmented\n  Programmatic Agent Pair",
      "summary": "Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape\nrequires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to\nlimitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying\nrestricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the\ncontinuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose\nBrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented\nplanner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search\nstrategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,\ntargeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This\ndivision of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining\nbroad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing\nagents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks\nshow that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary\nbaselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,\nwhich demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy\ninformation-seeking tasks at scale.",

      "title": "Complex Logical Instruction Generation",
      "summary": "Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities\nsuch as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the\nlogic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly\nintricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions\nremains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a\nscalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code\nfunctions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,\nnesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of\ncomplex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark\ncomprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the\ninstructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the\ninstructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following\nability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF",

      "title": "OdysseyBench: Evaluating LLM Agents on Long-Horizon Complex Office\n  Application Workflows",
      "summary": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly\ndeployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.\nHowever, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are\nself-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual\ndependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic\nscenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse\noffice applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our\nbenchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks\nderived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly\nsynthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential\ninformation from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step\nreasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,\nwe propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation\nof long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,\ntask generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates\nthat OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing\nmore accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts\ncompared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will\nserve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of\nLLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release\nOdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.",

However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,\nrendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute\ngenerated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus\nundermining privacy leakage accountability\n  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership\nAudit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content\nin a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the\nenvironmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an\nattribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which\nrobustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through\nlarge-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,\nSMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs\ninto textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the\ntext modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on\nimage retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of\nmembership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the\ncontent is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data\nprovenance in complex generative systems.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will\nserve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more\nchallenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.",

However, its significant computational costs have previously\nundermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled\nup to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show\nthat the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed\ncheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an\nactive-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we\ncan make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the\ntarget model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how\nwell active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to\nmore effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard\npractices.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades\nsignificantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.\nWhile methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the\nMassively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically\nuse only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses\nall intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the\nLLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for\noverall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns\ntoken-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's\nembedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is\ntrained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.\nEvaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,\nour Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge\nbaseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala\nclassification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements\nacross Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific\ngains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to\n71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more\ncapable and equitable multilingual LLMs.",

Learned image compression, a fundamental\ntask in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.\nHowever, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their\nrepresentation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression\nperformance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on\nscaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance\ntrends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as\nbaseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit\npower-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including\nmodel size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,\nenabling extrapolation to larger scale models.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each\ntoken depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the\ninference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant\nchallenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been\nproposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often\ninvolving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce\nREADER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel\nlossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by\nleveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative\ndecoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work\nfocuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for\nindustrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during\nspeculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for\nlarge batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding\nmethods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse\npre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\\%. Our method\ndemonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as\nretrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.",

      "summary": "Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in\npsychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises\nethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an\nLLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of\nclinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the\ntraining of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to\nensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute \"gold standard\"\nfor appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common\ntherapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective\ntriggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by\nthis, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for\nmistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as\nstandards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then\nconstructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes\nduring interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies\nmistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,\nthe final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The\ndetailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments\ndemonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide\nhigh-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant\npotential for the therapist training scenario.",

      "summary": "SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form\nwhile preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent\nrewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To\naddress these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting\nframework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It\nintegrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.\nExtensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\\% reduction in\nquery execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL\nbenchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\\% more successful rewrites,\nexpanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.",

      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,\nthe risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical\nsafety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives.

      "title": "KFFocus: Highlighting Keyframes for Enhanced Video Understanding",
      "summary": "Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have\ndemonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding\nbenchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational\nefficiency and enhanced accuracy.",
