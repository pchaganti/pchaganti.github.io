      "title": "From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering",
      "summary": "Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly\nbecoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts\nof conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal\ninterests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches\ntypically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights\nthat could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale\nconversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,\na novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of\nuser-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying\nemerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this\ndirection, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative\nquestions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments\nshow that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur\nprohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches\ncapable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.",

      "summary": "Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning\nabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated\ntheorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that\npoorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language\nknowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a\ncomprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to\nenhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems\nand proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for\ncorrectness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically\nconstructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement\nlearning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,\nleveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical\ninference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process\nevaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning\nsteps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly\nimproves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and\nsupervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to\nfundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical\nexploration.",

      "summary": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented\nagents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step\nreasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or\nmultimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess\ntool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo,\nan agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing\ntasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by\ntool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a\nwide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster\nassessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation\nanalysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site\nanalysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires\nagents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style\ninteraction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,\nQwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise\nexecution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable\ndisparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models.

      "title": "Bounded Rationality for LLMs: Satisficing Alignment at Inference-Time",
      "summary": "Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the\ninherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing\napproaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they\noften overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded\nrationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing\nstrategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable\nthresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing\nalignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the\nmultifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while\nsatisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide\ntheoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based\ninference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance\nthrough extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the\nPKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while\nensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmulti objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4\nwin-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on\nharmlessness.",

Despite significantly reducing\ncommunication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve\nall-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works\nhave explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error\nfeedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility\nremain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of\nstandard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization\nfor reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local\noptimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only\ntransformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner\noptimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to\naggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no\nperformance degradation.

      "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and\nknowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable\nLoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of\nfine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved\nknowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the\ntrainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data\nwhile avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide\ntheoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including\nsafety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream\ntasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning\nperformance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing\ncontemporary LoRA initialization methods.",

      "summary": "The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly\nadvanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,\nfailing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.\nFocusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based\nagentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML\ntasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a\nnovel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)\nexploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse\nactions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training\non a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving\ntraining efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies\nvaried ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.\nLeveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM\nfor autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our\n7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent.

We\nintroduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level\nstatistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection\nwith a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most\ninformative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit\nerror-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make\ntargeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,\nDEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the\nperformance of supervised fine-tuning.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating\nremarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often\nuncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient\nreasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of\npossessing the \\textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the\ncapacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most\nexisting studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely\nignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we\nintroduce the \\textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by\nincorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with\nmulti-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15\nrepresentative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on\nexplicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)\nPremise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with\ndirect contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;\n(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique\nability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly\nlengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded\ntasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social\nreasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social\nreasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'\nmental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,\nthere is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively\nassesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often\noversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to\nchallenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze\nsystematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic\ninteraction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across\nthree key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and\ndigital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to\nensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary\nsubstantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate\ntemporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning\nperform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;\nand model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty.

      "summary": "Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered\nsignificant attention in both the mathematical and computer science\ncommunities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural\nLanguage (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the\npotential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,\nRL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base\nmodel, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math\nreasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent\ndisparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end\nframework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.\nTo bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem\nAlignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in\nNL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*\ntechnique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence\nproblems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in\nreasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves\n**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC\nbenchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.\nNotably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL\nbaseline model even under a larger number of trials.",

However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract\nformulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and\narithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled\nevaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of\nLlama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the\narithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary\nto the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with\nlimited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two\nskills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any\nreasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture\nproblem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these\nabstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.\nThese behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled\nevaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.",

In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by\ntraining transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our\nanalysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,\nfollowed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution\ngeneralization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but\naccelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level\nexposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we\nintroduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies\nsemantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based\nrepresentational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with\nthe cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn\nprovides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across\ntraining, linking representational structure to reasoning capability.
