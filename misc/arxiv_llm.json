      "title": "From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via\n  Streaming Content Monitoring",
      "summary": "Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models\n(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the\nexternal safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly\npractice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based\non the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more\nattention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway\nand early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply\nmoderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,\nintroducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this\npaper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports\npartial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of\n29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable\nsupervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content\nmonitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level\nlabels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of\nharmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is\ncomparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in\nresponses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness\nannotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness\nscore than DPO.",

      "title": "Flipping Against All Odds: Reducing LLM Coin Flip Bias via Verbalized\n  Rejection Sampling",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability\ndistributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate\nfaithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring\nreliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,\nand randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and\nsampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized\nRejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection\nsampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed\nsamples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS\nsubstantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical\nanalysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct\nsampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More\nbroadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized\nand embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring\naccess to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.",

      "summary": "Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit\nparallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce\nMultiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.\nMultiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through\nthree stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process\nstage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless\nresult synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with\nco-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer\nfrom frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create\nMultiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an\nautomated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.\nAlgorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning\nsteps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.\nSystematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It\nfeatures a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and\nparallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour\nfine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only\nopen-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of\nthe same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.\nMoreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits\nsuperior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same\ncontext length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,\nachieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the\nentire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting\ntools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and\nevaluation recipes.",

      "summary": "Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting\nAI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short\ntext length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is\nnonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a\nsignificant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered\nthrough the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)\nparticular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the\nmindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a\ndataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of\nopen-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different\ncontroversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under\ntypical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating\nmodels, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release\ntheir fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This\nresult is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the\nvulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result\nhas implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally\napplicable and realistic LLM use case.",

Insufficient SRL skills can lead\nto disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,\nundermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a\nformative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges\nstudents face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with\ngoal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL\nskills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models\n(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables\nstudents to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection\nwithin an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time\nfeedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study\nefforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to\na baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia\nlearning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills\nwithin the SRLAgent group (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement\ncompared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL\nscaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering\ndesign implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper\nlearning and metacognitive skill development.",

      "title": "Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Interwoven\n  Thinking and Visual Drawing",
      "summary": "As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced\nsignificantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal\nreasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze\nnavigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and\nmulti-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.",

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring\nand task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream\nutility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers\ninterpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.",

However, best practices for RL in\ninstruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the\nverification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a\nverification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based\nverification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this\napproach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,\nVerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated\nverification signals.

      "title": "The Emergence of Abstract Thought in Large Language Models Beyond Any\n  Language",
      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to\nfunction effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked\nimprovement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families\nsupport our approach.",

Counterintuitively, we find that\nhallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared\nto grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from\nsuperficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this\ninsight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional\ndistances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external\nknowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable\nkernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences\nbetween distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method\nremains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable\nsolution for hallucination detection.",

We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through\nthe dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability\nof Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are\nlogically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to\nquantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different\nintervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing\nsteps and the pruning of redundant ones.
