      "title": "Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions",
      "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.",

      "summary": "We present LLMberjack, a platform for creating multi-party conversations starting from existing debates, originally structured as reply trees. The system offers an interactive interface that visualizes discussion trees and enables users to construct coherent linearized dialogue sequences while preserving participant identity and discourse relations. It integrates optional large language model (LLM) assistance to support automatic editing of the messages and speakers' descriptions. We demonstrate the platform's utility by showing how tree visualization facilitates the creation of coherent, meaningful conversation threads and how LLM support enhances output quality while reducing human effort. The tool is open-source and designed to promote transparent and reproducible workflows to create multi-party conversations, addressing a lack of resources of this type.",

      "title": "ContextFocus: Activation Steering for Contextual Faithfulness in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.",

However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.",

      "summary": "Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \\textbf{\\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.",

      "title": "KDCM: Reducing Hallucination in LLMs through Explicit Reasoning Structures",
      "summary": "To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.",

      "title": "Modular Prompt Optimization: Optimizing Structured Prompts with Section-Local Textual Gradients",
      "summary": "Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.",

      "title": "Stable Language Guidance for Vision-Language-Action Models",
      "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \\textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \\textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.",

      "summary": "As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

      "summary": "Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.",

      "summary": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.",

Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.",

To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models.

Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.",

      "summary": "The continued promise of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in their natural language understanding and generation capabilities, has driven a rapidly increasing interest in identifying and developing LLM use cases. In an effort to complement the ingrained \"knowledge\" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations.",

      "title": "FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion",
      "summary": "Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.",

To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.",

Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.",
