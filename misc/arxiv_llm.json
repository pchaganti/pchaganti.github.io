      "title": "Generative Reasoning Recommendation via LLMs",
      "summary": "Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as\ngenerative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic\nmodeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,\ncombined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents\nsignificant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting\npre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction\nmanner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that\nintegrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses\nheterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete\nitem indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic\nrepresentations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,\nwhich builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and\na curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent\npreference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised\nsequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization\n(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward\nand Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end\noptimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively\nsupports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for\nhigh-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning\nRecommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal\ntransparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over\nstrong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM\nrecommenders.",

      "title": "On the Detectability of LLM-Generated Text: What Exactly Is\n  LLM-Generated Text?",
      "summary": "With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers\nhave turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there\nis no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely \"LLM-generated\ntext\". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation\napproaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world\ndetector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often\nmisunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors\nremain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be\ninterpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.",

      "title": "Video Prediction of Dynamic Physical Simulations With Pixel-Space\n  Spatiotemporal Transformers",
      "summary": "Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language\nmodels (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual\ndomain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction\nwith a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal\nself-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations\nover time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we\nattempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking\nmetrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce\na simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video\nprediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video\nprediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent\nfeature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time\nhorizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with\nexisting latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on\ncommon video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability\nexperiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to\nperform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,\nand find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution\nsimulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further\nattention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter\nefficient, and interpretable approach.",

      "title": "Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient\n  Step on 100 Samples",
      "summary": "Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank\nreduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of\ncarefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without\nany gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.",

      "summary": "A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft\ncontext compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter\ncontinuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling\napproach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens\narchitecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple\ncompression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and\nout-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and\ncompression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the\nstrongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple\ncompression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training\nregimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of\ncompression methods.",

      "title": "Out-of-distribution Tests Reveal Compositionality in Chess Transformers",
      "summary": "Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and\nlong-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -\nare able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they\ntruly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M\nparameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,\ndesigned to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy\nadaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit\nsearch, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the\ntraining dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own\npieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.",

      "summary": "Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus\non high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI\napplication. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for\nResponsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are\nhighly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this\nwork, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application\n(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),\nparameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and\nproduct categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use\nthe data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,\ncontributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for\nthe research community.",

      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant\narchitectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in\nCyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to\npoisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts\nas cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and\nsophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and\nstylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of\nmodern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility\nalgorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score\nto malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized\nMS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our\nalgorithm on CTI documents and feeds.",

      "summary": "We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI\ninteraction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with\nimplicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial\nexpression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them\nas contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal\ninterfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it\nunobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for\nconversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and\nscalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe\nthe system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,\nand report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show\nconsistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with\nparticipants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of\nconcept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated\ncommunication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where\nusers' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.",

      "summary": "Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability\nreports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how\ncan security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true\nvulnerabilities?\n  This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to\nprioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on\nNode.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each\ncontaining one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of\nmachine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks\n(GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and\nLLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The\ntop LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models\nreaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading\nmodel eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60\nms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of\n0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can\ndetect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating\nstrong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.",
