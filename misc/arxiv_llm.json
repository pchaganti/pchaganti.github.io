      "title": "Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in\ninformation retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high\ncomputational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies\nevaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as\nlatency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.\nHowever, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\\eg\nparallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,\nmaking it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the\nefficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose\nE\\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per\nPetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for\nhardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable\nFLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even\nwithout running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with\ndifferent architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and\nbringing this issue to the attention of the research community.",

      "title": "Differential Mamba",
      "summary": "Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to\nirrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This\ndegrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and\nretrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that\ndifferential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their\neffectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether\nthese techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to\nMamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that\nachieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a\nnaive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires\ncareful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel\ndifferential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling\nbenchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior\nperformance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies\nand empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that\nour approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based\nmodels. Our code is publicly available.",

      "title": "A Survey on Latent Reasoning",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning\ncapabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both\ninterpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning\nlimits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this\nbottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's\ncontinuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role\nof neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,\nhighlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.\nNext, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including\nactivation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning\nstrategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we\ndiscuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked\ndiffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning\nprocesses. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual\nlandscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the\nfrontier of LLM cognition.

      "summary": "Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries\nfor benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is\nchallenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are\nlimited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address\nthis issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)\neliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while\nproviding the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to\nconstrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of\nqueries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and\nexecution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift\nand Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost\ndistributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber\nintroduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate\ncustomized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a\nself-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based\non query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different\npredicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost\ndistribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty\nlevels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from\nSnowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show\nthat SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.\nIt reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and\nsignificantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared\nwith existing methods.",

      "title": "Hidden Prompts in Manuscripts Exploit AI-Assisted Peer Review",
      "summary": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were\nfound to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate\nAI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as \"GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY\"\nwere concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses\nvaried: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the\npractice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes\nthis practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique\nof prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of\nhidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed\nevaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as \"honeypots\" to detect\nreviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently\nself-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.\nPublishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer\nreview entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure\nrequirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond\npeer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including\nplagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need\nfor coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized\npolicies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

      "title": "Data-Semantics-Aware Recommendation of Diverse Pivot Tables",
      "summary": "Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently\nscales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present\nseveral case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over\ncommercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).",

Its key innovation lies\nin effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily\nstems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively\nactivates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for\nadditional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover\nthe fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal\nalignment for multimodal reasoning models.

As artificial intelligence provides scalable tools for\nmodelling human outcomes, it is crucial to evaluate whether large language\nmodels (LLMs) can accurately predict well-being across diverse global\npopulations. We evaluate four leading LLMs using data from 64,000 individuals\nin 64 countries. While LLMs capture broad correlates such as income and health,\ntheir predictive accuracy decreases in countries underrepresented in the\ntraining data, highlighting systematic biases rooted in global digital and\neconomic inequality. A pre-registered experiment demonstrates that LLMs rely on\nsurface-level linguistic similarity rather than conceptual understanding,\nleading to systematic misestimations in unfamiliar or resource-limited\nsettings.

We\nintroduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs\nacross three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,\nand test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive\nprogramming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent\nsystem across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and\nrobustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift\nbetween model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to\ncluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study\ndemonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and\ndiverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially\nenhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal\nboth the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may\nfacilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential\ndirection for developing more powerful coding models.",

The model is\ntrained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and\nhigh-resolution instruction tuning.

Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of\nusers and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss due to\ndimensionality reduction, sparse interactions, and so on. With the advancements\nof large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, some methods use\nembeddings as LLM inputs for explanation generation.
