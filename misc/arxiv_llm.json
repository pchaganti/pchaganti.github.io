      "title": "LNE-Blocking: An Efficient Framework for Contamination Mitigation\n  Evaluation on Large Language Models",
      "summary": "The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly\nintegrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem\nsubsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing\ncontamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on\npotentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:\ncontamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework\nfirst uses the contamination detection method, \\textbf{LNE}, to assess the\nextent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity\nof the disruption operation, \\textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized\nresponses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the\nmodel's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on\nmultiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves\nstable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data\ncontamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking\nto facilitate research.",

      "title": "Assessing Historical Structural Oppression Worldwide via Rule-Guided\n  Prompting of Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with\ncross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of\nexclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have\nrelied on structured indices that privilege material resources while\noverlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for\noppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\ncontext-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse\ngeopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances\nfrom a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting\nstrategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically\ngrounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when\nguided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based\nhistorical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary\nmeasurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a\nscalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in\ndata-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible\nevaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on\noppression measurement\n(https://github.com/chattergpt/llm-oppression-benchmark).",

      "summary": "Extended reality (XR) applications increasingly integrate Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to enhance user experience, scene understanding, and even\ngenerate executable XR content, and are often called \"AI glasses\". Despite\nthese potential benefits, the integrated XR-LLM pipeline makes XR applications\nvulnerable to new forms of attacks. In this paper, we analyze LLM-Integated XR\nsystems in the literature and in practice and categorize them along different\ndimensions from a systems perspective. Building on this categorization, we\nidentify a common threat model and demonstrate a series of proof-of-concept\nattacks on multiple XR platforms that employ various LLM models (Meta Quest 3,\nMeta Ray-Ban, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 running Llama and GPT models).\nAlthough these platforms each implement LLM integration differently, they share\nvulnerabilities where an attacker can modify the public context surrounding a\nlegitimate LLM query, resulting in erroneous visual or auditory feedback to\nusers, thus compromising their safety or privacy, sowing confusion, or other\nharmful effects. To defend against these threats, we discuss mitigation\nstrategies and best practices for developers, including an initial defense\nprototype, and call on the community to develop new protection mechanisms to\nmitigate these risks.",

      "summary": "We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing\ninstead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods\n(\\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while\nneglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In\ncontrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution\nusing a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL\ndivergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this\nidea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration\nand generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and\ncode reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of\n$10.0\\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs\nconsistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward\ndistribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse\nreasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.",

      "summary": "Jailbreak attacks pose persistent threats to large language models (LLMs).\nCurrent safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but\nthey experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment\ndepth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prefilling and refusal direction\nmanipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework\nthat overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically\nrebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by\nprobabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths\nduring fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against prefilling and refusal\ndirection attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen\njailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source LLM families\nand six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success\nrates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal\nperformance degradation.",

While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor\nexecutions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to\nconfiguring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual\neffort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or\ninput minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a\ncomplete fuzzing campaign.\n  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of\nfuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns\nto scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs\nfor code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools\nfor verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision.\nAcross our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on\nthe workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery\nof two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib\nlibrary.",

      "title": "Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection,\n  Novelty Promotes Variation",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement\nlearning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands\nmodels that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing\nlabel-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote\nobjectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an\nentropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike\nprior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which\nprimarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is\nbroader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's\ninherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We\nformalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free\nReinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with\nvariation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer\nas a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors\nresponses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced\n(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also\nuses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer\nto sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design\nprevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and\nimproves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the\nmajority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts\nQwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%\nto 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks\nstronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,\nhighlighting its broad applicability.",

      "summary": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal\ntube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We\nevaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods\non three common STVG benchmarks.\n  The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.",

      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nretrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy\nand verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts.",

Existing\nstudies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all\ntest instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually\nassign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human\nannotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all\ntest instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test\ninstances.

We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation\nand SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on\nrepresentation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.\nIt also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows\neach client to select the optimal number of utilized experts.
