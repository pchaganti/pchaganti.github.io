      "summary": "We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited\ngeneralization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical\nanalysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic\nreward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of\nmodel. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing\ngradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function\nwith the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change\nsignificantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks\nand base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,\nour approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an\neffective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and\npractical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be\navailable at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.",

      "title": "How Do LLMs Persuade? Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in\n  Multi-Turn Conversations",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.",

      "title": "Simulating Human-Like Learning Dynamics with LLM-Empowered Agents",
      "summary": "Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a\nmajor research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior.",

      "summary": "Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,\nespecially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous\nvehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often\nlack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer\nimproved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,\nlimited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo\noutperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and\nnotably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to\nan unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the\nautomated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction\nheuristics.

      "title": "Cooper: Co-Optimizing Policy and Reward Models in Reinforcement Learning\n  for Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in\nreasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm\nfor enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that\ndynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,\nproviding a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.",

      "title": "Uni-cot: Towards Unified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Text and\n  Vision",
      "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Existing synthesis methods largely rely on\ntransforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.\nWe propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging\nmathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing\nproblems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling\nconcept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and\navoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined\nstrategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts\nreinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning\ncomplexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated\nunder autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,\nencouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with\nlong-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,\ncategorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,\nOlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines\nunder both short and long CoT settings.

      "summary": "Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple\nseen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise\nintra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class\nreasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive\nTransfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed\nusing structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs\ngraph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between\nclass representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to\nexplicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive\ninter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class\nrefinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, validating its effectiveness.",

      "summary": "Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training\nloop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely\nrecognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT\nresearch focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,\nwhere the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling).

We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting\nthem to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting\nadvice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in\nthe models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left\nor right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data\nonly. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant\ncross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect.

Our approach involves multiple\nindependent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with\nthe most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy\n(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,\nMedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms\nlogit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as\nmeasured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical\nmiscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling\nfrequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in\nblack-box scenarios.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring\nspecialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates\nthis by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning\nscenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of\nstructured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from\n\\textit{Discours de la m\\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented\nGeneration (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through\nsystematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,\nLAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by\nlogical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG\nsignificantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns\nLLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to\nexisting RAG systems.",

      "title": "Auto-Eval Judge: Towards a General Agentic Framework for Task Completion\n  Evaluation",
      "summary": "The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains\nnecessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our\nframework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA\nand BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement\nto human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,\nrespectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This\ndemonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation\nframework.",
