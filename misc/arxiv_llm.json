      "title": "Skill-Inject: Measuring Agent Vulnerability to Skill File Attacks",
      "summary": "LLM agents are evolving rapidly, powered by code execution, tools, and the recently introduced agent skills feature. Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks. Our benchmark is available at https://www.skill-inject.com/.",

      "title": "Agentic AI for Scalable and Robust Optical Systems Control",
      "summary": "We present AgentOptics, an agentic AI framework for high-fidelity, autonomous optical system control built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems.",

      "title": "Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Rules?",
      "summary": "Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers.",

      "summary": "With the rise of large language models (LLMs), they have become instrumental in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation.",

      "summary": "The paradigm of automated program generation is shifting from one-shot generation to inference-time search, where Large Language Models (LLMs) function as semantic mutation operators within evolutionary loops. While effective, these systems are currently governed by static schedules that fail to account for the non-stationary dynamics of the search process. This rigidity results in substantial computational waste, as resources are indiscriminately allocated to stagnating populations while promising frontiers remain under-exploited. We introduce AdaEvolve, a framework that reformulates LLM-driven evolution as a hierarchical adaptive optimization problem. AdaEvolve uses an \"accumulated improvement signal\" to unify decisions across three levels: Local Adaptation, which dynamically modulates the exploration intensity within a population of solution candidates; Global Adaptation, which routes the global resource budget via bandit-based scheduling across different solution candidate populations; and Meta-Guidance which generates novel solution tactics based on the previously generated solutions and their corresponding improvements when the progress stalls. We demonstrate that AdaEvolve consistently outperforms the open-sourced baselines across 185 different open-ended optimization problems including combinatorial, systems optimization and algorithm design problems.",

      "title": "LAD: Learning Advantage Distribution for Reasoning",
      "summary": "Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.",

      "summary": "Objective: To improve the efficiency of medical question answering (MedQA) with large language models (LLMs) by avoiding unnecessary reasoning while maintaining accuracy.\n  Methods: We propose Selective Chain-of-Thought (Selective CoT), an inference-time strategy that first predicts whether a question requires reasoning and generates a rationale only when needed. Two open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B) were evaluated on four biomedical QA benchmarks-HeadQA, MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Metrics included accuracy, total generated tokens, and inference time.\n  Results: Selective CoT reduced inference time by 13-45% and token usage by 8-47% with minimal accuracy loss ($\\leq$4\\%). In some model-task pairs, it achieved both higher accuracy and greater efficiency than standard CoT. Compared with fixed-length CoT, Selective CoT reached similar or superior accuracy at substantially lower computational cost.\n  Discussion: Selective CoT dynamically balances reasoning depth and efficiency by invoking explicit reasoning only when beneficial, reducing redundancy on recall-type questions while preserving interpretability.\n  Conclusion: Selective CoT provides a simple, model-agnostic, and cost-effective approach for medical QA, aligning reasoning effort with question complexity to enhance real-world deployability of LLM-based clinical systems.",

      "title": "NanoKnow: How to Know What Your Language Model Knows",
      "summary": "How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know? Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a \"black box\" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow.",

      "title": "Benchmarking Unlearning for Vision Transformers",
      "summary": "Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.",

      "summary": "Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.",

      "title": "CausalFlip: A Benchmark for LLM Causal Judgment Beyond Semantic Matching",
      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.",

      "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on retrieved external documents, but the effect of retrieved context is often non-trivial. In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design.",

      "title": "Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Principles?",
      "summary": "Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.",

The proof establishes semantic preservation for the administrative normal form (ANF) transformation in the CertiCoq verified compiler for Rocq. The closely related continuation-passing style (CPS) transformation in CertiCoq was previously proved correct by human experts over several months. We use this proof as a template and instruct the LLM to adapt the proof technique to the ANF setting, which differs in important technical ways. The resulting ANF proof comprises approximately 7,800 lines of Rocq (larger than the 5,300-line CPS proof) and was developed in approximately 96 hours. We describe the proof technique and report on the experience of developing it with an LLM, discussing both the strengths and limitations of the approach and its implications for verified compiler construction.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical role in how humans access information. While their core use relies on comprehending written requests, our understanding of this ability is currently limited, because most benchmarks evaluate LLMs in high-resource languages predominantly spoken by Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) communities. The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities.",

      "title": "The LLMbda Calculus: AI Agents, Conversations, and Information Flow",
      "summary": "A conversation with a large language model (LLM) is a sequence of prompts and responses, with each response generated from the preceding conversation. AI agents build such conversations automatically: given an initial human prompt, a planner loop interleaves LLM calls with tool invocations and code execution. This tight coupling creates a new and poorly understood attack surface. A malicious prompt injected into a conversation can compromise later reasoning, trigger dangerous tool calls, or distort final outputs. Despite the centrality of such systems, we currently lack a principled semantic foundation for reasoning about their behaviour and safety. We address this gap by introducing an untyped call-by-value lambda calculus enriched with dynamic information-flow control and a small number of primitives for constructing prompt-response conversations. Our language includes a primitive that invokes an LLM: it serializes a value, sends it to the model as a prompt, and parses the response as a new term. This calculus faithfully represents planner loops and their vulnerabilities, including the mechanisms by which prompt injection alters subsequent computation. The semantics explicitly captures conversations, and so supports reasoning about defenses such as quarantined sub-conversations, isolation of generated code, and information-flow restrictions on what may influence an LLM call. A termination-insensitive noninterference theorem establishes integrity and confidentiality guarantees, demonstrating that a formal calculus can provide rigorous foundations for safe agentic programming.",

      "summary": "As multi-agent architectures and agent-to-agent protocols proliferate, a fundamental question arises: what actually happens when autonomous LLM agents interact at scale? We study this question empirically using data from Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social platform, with 800K posts, 3.5M comments, and 78K agent profiles. We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\\%$) and off-topic content ($22\\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic. Agents rarely engage in threaded conversation ($5\\%$ of comments), defaulting instead to independent top-level responses. We discuss implications for multi-agent interaction design, arguing that coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed; without them, even large populations of capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange.",

      "summary": "Visual navigation typically assumes the existence of at least one obstacle-free path between start and goal, which must be discovered/planned by the robot. However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware.",

Our results indicate that the word entropy of such LLMs is lower than the word entropy of natural speech both in written or spoken form.
