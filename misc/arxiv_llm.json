      "title": "Reinforced Attention Learning",
      "summary": "Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.\n  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.",

      "title": "Rethinking the Trust Region in LLM Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.",

      "title": "Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity",
      "summary": "Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.\n  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.",

      "title": "CoT is Not the Chain of Truth: An Empirical Internal Analysis of Reasoning LLMs for Fake News Generation",
      "summary": "From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.",

      "title": "Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training",
      "summary": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.",

      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).",

      "summary": "Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.",

      "summary": "While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.",

      "title": "NeuroCanvas: VLLM-Powered Robust Seizure Detection by Reformulating Multichannel EEG as Image",
      "summary": "Accurate and timely seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for clinical intervention, yet manual review of long-term recordings is labor-intensive. Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.",

      "title": "Beyond Many-Shot Translation: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations For Low-Resource Machine Translation",
      "summary": "Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.",

      "title": "When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.",

We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\\% to +38.5\\%, achieving up to 74\\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts.

      "title": "Inference-Time Reasoning Selectively Reduces Implicit Social Bias in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.",

We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.",

Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.",

Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.\n  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance.

      "summary": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.",

      "summary": "Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.",
