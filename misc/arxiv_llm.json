      "title": "The Promise of Large Language Models in Digital Health: Evidence from\n  Sentiment Analysis in Online Health Communities",
      "summary": "Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.",

      "title": "Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation",
      "summary": "Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into\nagentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to\nsolve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that\nprefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance\ngains.

      "title": "Beyond Pass@1: Self-Play with Variational Problem Synthesis Sustains\n  RLVR",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for\ncomplex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to\nimprove Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced\ngeneration diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically\nrepresents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective\nof training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems\nhelps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,\nwe propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)\nstrategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to\nsynthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain\nidentical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains\npolicy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with\nstandard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains\nof 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and\nAIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model\nsizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and\nrobustness of SvS.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved\nthe performance of dialog systems, yet current approaches often fail to provide\naccurate guidance of topic due to their inability to discern user confusion in\nrelated concepts. To address this, we introduce the Ask-Good-Question (AGQ)\nframework, which features an improved Concept-Enhanced Item Response Theory\n(CEIRT) model to better identify users' knowledge levels. Our contributions\ninclude applying the CEIRT model along with LLMs to directly generate guiding\nquestions based on the inspiring text, greatly improving information retrieval\nefficiency during the question & answer process. Through comparisons with other\nbaseline methods, our approach outperforms by significantly enhencing the\nusers' information retrieval experiences.",

      "title": "Chunks as Arms: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Sampling for Long-Context LLM\n  Preference Optimization",
      "summary": "Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,\nincluding long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning\ntasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and\nexploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context\nsegments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.\nFinally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and\napply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show\nthat LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference\ndata pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning\nbenchmarks.

      "summary": "This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become\nvirtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?\nIn this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open\nsource multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a\nframework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to\nharness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual\nexperiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process\nthat leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated\nPyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple\nsingle-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full\nvehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,\nthey often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve\non. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the\nsimulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general\nand can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated\nwith other application domains.",

      "title": "Learning to Use AI for Learning: How Can We Effectively Teach and\n  Measure Prompting Literacy for K-12 Students?",
      "summary": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily\nlife, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to\napply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.\nPrior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach\nstudents the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this\nneed, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting\nliteracy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with\ndirect interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary\nschool students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two\niterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education\nclassrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'\nprompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and\n3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the\nAI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory\nquality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in\nimproving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in\ntheir perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1\ninformed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and\ndiscrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could\nmeasure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for\nour target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for\nbroader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess\nlearning effectiveness and assessment design.",

      "summary": "In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer\nreview ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business\nperformance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),\na novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge\ngraphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating\nsentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the\nframework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.\nWe compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag\nof Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating\nthem in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,\nour proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with\nlower computational cost (without ensemble).\n  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and\noutperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it\noffers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and\npotential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This\nwork highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing\nreview analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating\nadvanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current\npractices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,\nand tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing\ncomplex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or\nmanaging presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we\nintroduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs\ncomponent-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),\nspecialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system\nto decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It\nincludes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit\n(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate\nPOML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application\nintegration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user\nstudy assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.",

      "summary": "Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are essential for medical\ntraining, but they require significant resources, including professional actors\nand expert medical feedback. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nintroduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these\nsimulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions.\nThis paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based\nsimulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more\nrealistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore,\nour system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant,\npersonalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated\nencounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's\nreal-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy.\nPreliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and\ncoherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and\nappropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments. This innovative system\nprovides medical students with a low-cost, accessible platform for personalized\nOSCE preparation at home.",
