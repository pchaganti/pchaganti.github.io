      "title": "Heterogeneous Low-Bandwidth Pre-Training of LLMs",
      "summary": "Pre-training large language models (LLMs) increasingly requires distributed compute, yet bandwidth constraints make it difficult to scale beyond well-provisioned datacenters-especially when model parallelism forces frequent, large inter-device communications. We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training.",

      "summary": "This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.",

      "title": "Robust Persona-Aware Toxicity Detection with Prompt Optimization and Learned Ensembling",
      "summary": "Toxicity detection is inherently subjective, shaped by the diverse perspectives and social priors of different demographic groups. While ``pluralistic'' modeling as used in economics and the social sciences aims to capture perspective differences across contexts, current Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques have different results across different personas and base models. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of persona-aware toxicity detection, showing that no single prompting method, including our proposed automated prompt optimization strategy, uniformly dominates across all model-persona pairs. To exploit complementary errors, we explore ensembling four prompting variants and propose a lightweight meta-ensemble: an SVM over the 4-bit vector of prompt predictions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SVM ensemble consistently outperforms individual prompting methods and traditional majority-voting techniques, achieving the strongest overall performance across diverse personas. This work provides one of the first systematic comparisons of persona-conditioned prompting for toxicity detection and offers a robust method for pluralistic evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.",

After the text was generated, this parameter can be estimated using maximum likelihood approach. Following it, we propose a procedure to estimate the temperature of any text, including ones written by humans, with respect to a given language model. We evaluate the temperature estimation capability of a wide selection of small-to-medium LLMs. We then use the best-performing Qwen3 14B to estimate temperatures of popular corpora.",

      "title": "Project Ariadne: A Structural Causal Framework for Auditing Faithfulness in LLM Agents",
      "summary": "As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While \\textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \\textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \\textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \\textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \\textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \\textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($φ$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \\textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \\textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($ρ$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as \"Reasoning Theater\" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.",

      "title": "Octopus: A Lightweight Entity-Aware System for Multi-Table Data Discovery and Cell-Level Retrieval",
      "summary": "Tabular data constitute a dominant form of information in modern data lakes and repositories, yet discovering the relevant tables to answer user questions remains challenging. Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

      "title": "Power-of-Two Quantization-Aware-Training (PoT-QAT) in Large Language Models (LLMs)",
      "summary": "In Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, e.g., from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT-2 to 175 billion in GPT-3 to possibly more than trillion in higher versions. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision.",

      "title": "ELLA: Efficient Lifelong Learning for Adapters in Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe catastrophic forgetting when adapted sequentially to new tasks in a continual learning (CL) setting. Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation.",

      "title": "From XAI to Stories: A Factorial Study of LLM-Generated Explanation Quality",
      "summary": "Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP and LIME produce numerical feature attributions that remain inaccessible to non expert users. Prior work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform these outputs into natural language explanations (NLEs), but it remains unclear which factors contribute to high-quality explanations. We present a systematic factorial study investigating how Forecasting model choice, XAI method, LLM selection, and prompting strategy affect NLE quality. Our design spans four models (XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and SARIMAX - comparing black-box Machine-Learning (ML) against classical time-series approaches), three XAI conditions (SHAP, LIME, and a no-XAI baseline), three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1), and eight prompting strategies. Using G-Eval, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation method, with dual LLM judges and four evaluation criteria, we evaluate 660 explanations for time-series forecasting. Our results suggest that: (1) XAI provides only small improvements over no-XAI baselines, and only for expert audiences; (2) LLM choice dominates all other factors, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-3; (3) we observe an interpretability paradox: in our setting, SARIMAX yielded lower NLE quality than ML models despite higher prediction accuracy; (4) zero-shot prompting is competitive with self-consistency at 7-times lower cost; and (5) chain-of-thought hurts rather than helps.",

While industry practice has long optimized code for human comprehension, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs with different capabilities can edit code reliably. In this study, we investigate the concept of ``AI-friendly code'' via LLM-based refactoring on a dataset of 5,000 Python files from competitive programming. We find a meaningful association between CodeHealth, a quality metric calibrated for human comprehension, and semantic preservation after AI refactoring. Our findings confirm that human-friendly code is also more compatible with AI tooling. These results suggest that organizations can use CodeHealth to guide where AI interventions are lower risk and where additional human oversight is warranted.

      "summary": "Despite continuous advances in medical technology, the global distribution of health care resources remains uneven. The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.",

The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new \"Hinter-Guesser\" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents.",

Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

      "summary": "Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.",

      "summary": "Access to reliable agricultural advisory remains limited in many developing regions due to a persistent language barrier: authoritative agricultural manuals are predominantly written in English, while farmers primarily communicate in low-resource local languages such as Bengali. Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language interaction, direct generation in low-resource languages often exhibits poor fluency and factual inconsistency, while cloud-based solutions remain cost-prohibitive. This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds. The results indicate that cross-lingual retrieval combined with controlled translation offers a practical and scalable solution for agricultural knowledge access in low-resource language settings",
