      "title": "Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey",
      "summary": "In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language\nModels (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs).\nUnlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token,\nparallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based\ngeneration strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,\nfine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.\nThese capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.\nRecently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as\na large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance\ncomparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x\nacceleration in inference speed.\n  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven\nby progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs\nand MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and\nfoundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing\ndomain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete\ndiffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and\ndMLLMs research in early 2025.\n  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM\nand dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,\nformalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative\nmodels. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and\nsummarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and\nbiological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research\nand deployment.\n  Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey",

      "title": "Steering LLM Thinking with Budget Guidance",
      "summary": "Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to\nimprove performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it\nincurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains.\nControlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore\nimportant, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We\npropose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the\nreasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM\nfine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a\nGamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token\ngeneration. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level\nmanner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified\nthinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking\nlength, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline\nmethods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26%\naccuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to\nbaseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the\nthinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also\ngeneralizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as\nestimating question difficulty.

      "title": "Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection,\n  Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability",
      "summary": "Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent\ncybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying\ntactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in\nartificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the\ninterpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin\nphishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural\nLanguage Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction\nand potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks.\nHowever, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models\nrequires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and\ntrustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key\nquestion remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but\nalso generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and\ninternally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned\ntransformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve\ndomain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions,\nusing Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in\nphishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure\nbased on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token\nalignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover\nthe rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show\nthat Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with\nhigher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy,\nwhereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.",

      "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed\nretriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally\nacross all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that\ndynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both\ntrain-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a\nlearning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to\nrank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance.\nOur experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type\nvariations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best\nsingle-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in\nmodels trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise\nlearning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025\nLiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of\nour approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and\nfaithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training\nmethodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.",

      "summary": "Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central\nchallenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt\nengineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored\nlatent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations\nto guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's\neffectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction\nprompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across\ndiverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building\non insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting\n(InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction\nprompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost\ncombines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by\nprior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based\nmodels can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions.\nEmpirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both\ntraditional prompting and latent steering.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI\napplications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges\nfor deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in\neXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that\ninterpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing\ncomponents irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise\nRelevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.\nWhile LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend\nit to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially\nreduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially\neffective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --\nwhich can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).\nBuilding on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively\nremoving circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All\nin all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase\nits effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for\ncompression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,\nhighlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.

      "summary": "Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous\nsemantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster,\na reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to\nperform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized\ntime-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured\noutput format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is\noptimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence,\nprediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using\na two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish\na good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at\nthe token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in\ntime-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across\nsix real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series\nmodels and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain,\nrespectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it\nalso exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware\nexplanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that\nreward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating\ntemporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.",

      "summary": "Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale\nuser-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid\ndevelopments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a\nbreakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage\ncascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to\ncomputational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the\neffective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in\nrecommendation scenarios.\n  To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation\nsystem through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising\nresults. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current\nrecommendation model by 10 $\\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for\nrecommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning\ntechniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show\nsignificant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure\noptimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)\non flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely\nwith the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication\nand storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of\ntraditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP,\nit handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by\n0.54% and 1.24%, respectively.

      "title": "Balancing Knowledge Delivery and Emotional Comfort in Healthcare\n  Conversational Systems",
      "summary": "With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now\ncapable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical\nconditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience\nnegative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the\nmodel can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's\nnegative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a\nmore reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address\nthis issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and\nemotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large\nlanguage model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset,\ngenerating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical\nresponses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their\nconcerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models\nwith various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences\nwith both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to\npatients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental\nresults demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's\nability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original\ncapability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.",

      "summary": "Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs,\naffecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al.\n2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM\nOutputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior\nquality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p\nsampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's\nrecognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection\nfor an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of\nthe evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the\noriginal paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human\nevaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and\ndescribed qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p\ndid not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between\nquality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original\npaper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,\nand rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve\nover baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP\nbenchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the\nnumber of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge\nevaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.\nFourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars)\nwere found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised\nadoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the\noriginal paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,\nor a trade-off between quality and diversity.",

      "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for\nrapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks.\nPrefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability\nto achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly\nreduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier\nsuccess, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been\nvery limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning\nunderperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix\nsignificance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce\nPrefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of\nPrefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module\nout of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our\nconstruction process to guide future users when constructing their own\ncontext-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of\nbenchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning\nmethods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA\nmethod on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern\nextension of Prefix-Tuning approaches.

      "summary": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a\nexperience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven\nlearning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems.

      "summary": "The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the\nexploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more\nflexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously\nprovide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model\nresponses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal\nexperience.",

Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale\ntraining data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.\nHowever, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data\nhinders free-form semantic querying.

In\nour paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a\nsemantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to\nencode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without\npredefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,\nwhich accomplished through three key steps.

Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate\nsemantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged\nsuperpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic\nquerying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines\nscene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning.

In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric\nindicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains\nconstrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of\nsufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical\nfindings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit\noptimization process.

      "title": "CAMS: A CityGPT-Powered Agentic Framework for Urban Human Mobility\n  Simulation",
      "summary": "Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world\napplications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven\napproaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and\nreasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human\nmobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical\nshortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor\nintegration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility\ndistributions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered\n\\textbf{A}gentic framework for \\textbf{M}obility \\textbf{S}imulation\n(\\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban\nfoundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \\textbf{CAMS}\ncomprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template\nmobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator\nto generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate\ncandidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT,\nTrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and\ngenerate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show that \\textbf{CAMS} achieves superior\nperformance without relying on externally provided geospatial information.\nMoreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and\ncollective mobility constraints, \\textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and\nplausible trajectories. In general, \\textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm\nthat integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human\nmobility simulation.",
