      "title": "Generative Reasoning Recommendation via LLMs",
      "summary": "Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as\ngenerative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic\nmodeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,\ncombined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents\nsignificant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting\npre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction\nmanner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that\nintegrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses\nheterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete\nitem indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic\nrepresentations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,\nwhich builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and\na curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent\npreference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised\nsequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization\n(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward\nand Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end\noptimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively\nsupports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for\nhigh-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning\nRecommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal\ntransparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over\nstrong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM\nrecommenders.",

      "summary": "With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers\nhave turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there\nis no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely \"LLM-generated\ntext\". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation\napproaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world\ndetector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often\nmisunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors\nremain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be\ninterpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.",

      "summary": "Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language\nmodels (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual\ndomain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction\nwith a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal\nself-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations\nover time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we\nattempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking\nmetrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce\na simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video\nprediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video\nprediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent\nfeature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time\nhorizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with\nexisting latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on\ncommon video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability\nexperiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to\nperform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,\nand find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution\nsimulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further\nattention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter\nefficient, and interpretable approach.",

      "summary": "Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank\nreduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of\ncarefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without\nany gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.",

Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -\nare able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they\ntruly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M\nparameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,\ndesigned to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy\nadaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit\nsearch, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the\ntraining dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own\npieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.",

      "title": "Thought Communication in Multiagent Collaboration",
      "summary": "Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,\nambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.\nWhile machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent\nsystems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their\nembeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work\nilluminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges\nremain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of\ncompute or data scale.",

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937).

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as\ndrafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility.",

      "summary": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting\nkey-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that\nfundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache\ncompression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize\nstorage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns\nthat emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first\nanalyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying\nlevels of redundancy across attention heads.

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization.

In this article, we provide an\noverview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on\nmultimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and\nprompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework\nthrough three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot\nscheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From\nexperimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous\nsystems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning\n(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,\nvarying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where\nconventional static optimization degrades.",
