      "title": "Towards Multimodal Understanding via Stable Diffusion as a Task-Aware\n  Feature Extractor",
      "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled\nimage-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.

      "title": "Vision-Language-Vision Auto-Encoder: Scalable Knowledge Distillation\n  from Diffusion Models",
      "summary": "Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong\ncaptioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of\nhigh-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper\nintroduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which\nstrategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the\ndecoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by\nregularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the\npretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills\nknowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous\nembeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality\nreconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the\nintermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct\na state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o\nand Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and\nsignificantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal\nimages for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models\n(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for\nmassive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure\nunder $1,000 USD.",

      "title": "Boosting Parameter Efficiency in LLM-Based Recommendation through\n  Sophisticated Pruning",
      "summary": "LLM-based recommender systems have made significant progress; however, the\ndeployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still\nhinders their real-world applications. This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly\nreduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation\nquality.

      "title": "Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Nutrition Analysis: A Benchmark\n  Enriched with Contextual Metadata",
      "summary": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for\nnutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary\nmodels, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.\nAdditionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its\ninteraction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This\nwork investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS\ncoordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into\nmeal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in\nestimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,\nmacronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also\nintroduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This\nopen dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and\nserves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs\n(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of\ncontextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images\nalone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information\nenhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,\nMultimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.\nEmpirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied\nthrough straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted\nnutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs\nfor improved nutrition analysis.",

      "summary": "The progression from traditional prompt engineering to a more rigorous\ndiscipline of prompt design marks a pivotal shift in human-LLM interaction. As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This\nminimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization\ndirectives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI\ninteractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework\nconsistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich\nand consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic,\nDeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and\nSmall-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.",

      "title": "Learning Deliberately, Acting Intuitively: Unlocking Test-Time Reasoning\n  in Multimodal LLMs",
      "summary": "Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly\nwhen applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,\nmultimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality\nalignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data\nannotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and\nreasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits\nscalability. To address these challenges, we propose the\nDeliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the\nunderstanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra\nannotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate\nreasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based\nformat reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to\nintuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and\nimplicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I\noutperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our\nfindings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable\nreasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time\nreasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.",

We propose three cooperative\nagents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and\nmap analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination\nAssistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation\nleg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image\nembeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to\ntrip plan disruptions.

Additionally, semantic agnostic feature\nextraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report\nGeneration (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual\nfeatures with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation\nprocess. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing\nlesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The\nvisual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored\nenhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure\nto improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching\nloss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.\nAdditionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality\nconcept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual\nmedical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.\nExperiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate\nthat MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in\nradiology report generation.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code\ngeneration, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting\ntechniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps,\nwhich act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human\nprogrammers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the\ncorrectness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known\nabout the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the\nthoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores\nthe external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by\nanalyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation\nbenchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by\nanalyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting\nLLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such\nas unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while\ninternal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even\nwhen CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to\ninstruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with\nflawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when\ngiven detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in\nCoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning\nand reliability.",

To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external\nknowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing\nhallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most\nnotably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate\nretrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different\ncomponents in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our\nanalysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade\nsignificantly even under minor query variations.

However, a\ndetailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a\nlimited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going\nundetected.

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500).

In this study, we validate the\neffectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models\nand service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,\nwe demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target\ndomain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a\ncost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.",
