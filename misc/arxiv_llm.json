      "title": "The Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark: Reproducing NanoGPT\n  Improvements",
      "summary": "Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to\nassist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is\nthe ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to\nreproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM\nSpeedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the\nNanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.\nEach of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records\ntraining script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from\npseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records\nexecute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse\ncode-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to\nhardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible\nand realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that\nrecent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement\nalready-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our\nbenchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to\nautomate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an\nautonomous research agent.",
