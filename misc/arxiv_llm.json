      "summary": "While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and\nscalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their\nunderlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and\ngeneralizable framework based on \\emph{cascaded question disclosure} that\nprovides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities\nwhile maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model\nresponses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information\nabout the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find\nthat our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also\ninduces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA\nparadigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and\nknowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.\nOur approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation\nsettings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation\noverestimates the differences in performance between models. We further\nvalidate our findings by extensive ablation studies.",

      "summary": "AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but\ncurrent practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls\nshort of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental\nlimitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general\nagents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and\nplans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce\nSimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based\non a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \\modelname\novercomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world\nmodel for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented\nusing LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the\nconcept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web\nbrowsing tasks show that \\modelname improves the success of flight search from\n0\\% to 32.2\\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent\nadvantage of up to 124\\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the\nadvantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited\nabout the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs\nthat can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,\na web-browsing agent built on \\modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a\nresearch demo for public testing.",

However, the\npresence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable\nInformation (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)\nfiles presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of\nimaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework\ndeveloped by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines\nrule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification\nfor comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.\n  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit\nand inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model\n(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of\nsynthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we\nemploy an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,\nextract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the\nNER pipeline for final redaction.

      "summary": "We introduce CFDagent, a zero-shot, multi-agent system that enables fully\nautonomous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from natural language\nprompts. CFDagent integrates three specialized LLM-driven agents: (i) the\nPreprocessing Agent that generates 3D geometries from textual or visual inputs\nusing a hybrid text-to-3D diffusion model (Point-E) and automatically meshes\nthe geometries; (ii) the Solver Agent that configures and executes an immersed\nboundary flow solver; and (iii) the Postprocessing Agent that analyzes and\nvisualizes the results, including multimodal renderings. These agents are\ninteractively guided by GPT-4o via conversational prompts, enabling intuitive\nand user-friendly interaction. We validate CFDagent by reproducing canonical\nsphere flows at Reynolds numbers of 100 and 300 using three distinct inputs: a\nsimple text prompt (i.e., \"sphere\"), an image-based input, and a standard\nsphere model. The computed drag and lift coefficients from meshes produced by\neach input approach closely match available data. The proposed system enables\nsynthesization of flow simulations and photorealistic visualizations for\ncomplex geometries. Through extensive tests on canonical and realistic\nscenarios, we demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and practical\napplicability of CFDagent.

      "summary": "Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of\nhuman-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source\nlarge language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in\nproviding memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative\ndatasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall\ninspiration.

In this paper, we address this\nchallenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a\ntheoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most\nrelevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes\ndemonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components\nthrough a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious\ndependencies that impair generalization.

Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall\nperformance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),\nwith a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).\nDomain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over\ngeneral-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and\neffectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a\nstandardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,\nfacilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and\nimprovement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential\nto promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in\nhealthcare environments.",
