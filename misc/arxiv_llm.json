      "title": "Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged\n  Information?",
      "summary": "Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal\nrepresentations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer\nLLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and\noperates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually\nprovide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,\nor do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental\ncontrols to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful\ninsights into the operations of LLMs.",

      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on\nknowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in\nparadigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing\ninteraction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of\nprior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a\nReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on\nBrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web\nagents.",

We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic\nfoundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn\ndiverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby\ncreating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to\npropose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the\ndeep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational\nmodels.

      "summary": "While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area\nof research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This\nmotivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions\nand understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a\nsimple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific\nrepresentations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show\nthat the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust\ntarget representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a\nsingle A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be\nperformed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented\ndata-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

      "title": "LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from\n  24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a\n  10-shot prompt",
      "summary": "BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional\ncontent rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,\ntext-based dietary monitoring tools.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring\nnuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,\ncounselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret\nhuman personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains\nunexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While\nprior work has simulated LLM \"personas\" using discrete Big Five labels on\nsocial media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth\npersonality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely\nunexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising\nsemi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five\ntrait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance\nacross three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with\nGPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA\narchitectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT\nand OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson\ncorrelations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits\nremain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with\nvalidated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal\ngains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on\nlatent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings\nunderscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and\nmotivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and\nalignment-oriented fine-tuning.",

During the process, they often re-derive the same\nintermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This\nsaturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study\na simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,\nreusable \"behaviors\" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive\nanalysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\"\nwhich supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into\nparameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved\ntest-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned\ninference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning\nreduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving\nbaseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter\nupdates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors\nfrom its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher\naccuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned\nSFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at\nconverting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla\nSFT.

Current FDA-cleared\nsystems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output\nmay limit clinical trust and utility.

We evaluated multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI\nassistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and\nMessidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source\nmedical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI\nassistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration\nwhere GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs.

We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which\neliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a\npersistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across\nthe batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.\nBeing group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in\nlong-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.\nFurthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive\ncurriculum via prioritized sampling.

Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the\naverage maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial\nabsolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,\n+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain\nin pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values.

      "summary": "The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more\ncomputational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM\napplications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force\nusers to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy\nexpensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply\nproblem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can\ninstead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation\nallows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources\nover time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases.\nEffectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges\nnevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common\ncomputational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies\nthat allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources.

Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as\nconventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment\nwith shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation\nstrategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by\napplying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language\nModel (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained\ntoken-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to\nusing coarse-grained sentence embeddings.

      "title": "Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models\n  in Many-to-One Matching Markets",
      "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including\ncombinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context\nLearning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and\naccessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,\napplying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential\nand structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning\nperformance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial\noptimization problems with preferential constraints.",
