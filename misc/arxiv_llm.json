      "title": "OmniVinci: Enhancing Architecture and Data for Omni-Modal Understanding\n  LLM",
      "summary": "Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive\nacross multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce\nOmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We\ncarefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.\nFor model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for\nstrengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared\nomni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing\nrelative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)\nConstrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in\nomni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that\ngenerates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that\nmodalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,\nOmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal\nunderstanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while\nusing just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to\nQwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream\napplications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.",

      "title": "PolySkill: Learning Generalizable Skills Through Polymorphic Abstraction",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now\npowering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external\nenvironments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating\nweb pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning\noften create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to\ngeneralize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to\nlearn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by\npolymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal\n(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).\nExperiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen\nwebsites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on\nunseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration\nsettings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of\nproposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work\nacross different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own\ngoals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,\nleading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline\nmethods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of\ncontinual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating\na skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing\nautonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web\ncontinuously.",

      "title": "InfiMed-ORBIT: Aligning LLMs on Open-Ended Complex Tasks via\n  Rubric-Based Incremental Training",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through\nreinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be\nprogrammatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models\nbenefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based\nobjectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in\nopen-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or\ncontext-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably\nmedical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas\nchallenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,\nan open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed\nfor high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue\ngeneration with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to\ndirect an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend\non external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided\nfeedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,\nour method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard\nbenchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving\nstate-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that\nrubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse\nconsultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These\nfindings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing\nLLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.",

      "summary": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand\nfor more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family\nof optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of\nmodel weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a\ntrajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.\nDiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies\nNesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,\nclaiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we\nempirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from\napplying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a\nnon-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov\nOuter Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains\nof 1.5 - 2.5$\\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23\ntraining FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its\nminimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO\nis a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW\nand Muon.",

      "summary": "So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional\nsettings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single\nobjectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern\nexamples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental\npollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of\nstate-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language\nModel-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being\nactively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,\nfine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,\nLLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such\nsettings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents\nengage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,\nself-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion\nis viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The\n`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise\ncomparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run\nQwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based\ncontext editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline\ncounterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and\nAlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively\nin statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and\nreliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and\nqualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical\npath to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.",

      "summary": "Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether\nprinciples from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of\nlarge language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing\ninadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on\nfixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,\nsubjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where\nLLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer\nassessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to\nevaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates\ngame-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a\nprincipled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human\npreferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between\ntheoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into\nthe promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,\ngame-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the\ncapabilities of LLMs.",

      "summary": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration\nwith collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are\ncrucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that\nLLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF\napproaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To\naddress this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF\nembeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a\ndisentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific\nvectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings\ninto LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment\nobjective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.\nHence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without\nfine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their\npre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation\ndatasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with\ninterpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.\nCode is available in https://github.com/YixinRoll/FACE.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to\naligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a\nreward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with\nreinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an\nExpectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator\ntypes and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation\nalgorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single\ngenerative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these\ncontributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness\nand personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.",

      "summary": "Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO\ngold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of\nlines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like\nLean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend\nand limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is\ntherefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,\nand existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --\nstruggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers.

ProofOptimizer is\ntrained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify\nsimplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates\nwithin an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof\nlength.

However, bugs within DL frameworks can\ncascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing\nreliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to\ndetect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across\nframeworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many\nDL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and\nfunctionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one\nAPI may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover\nshared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First,\nMirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to\nidentify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a\nspecific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.\nThird, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API\nunder test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger\nanalogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four\npopular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor).

We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as\nsamplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:\nValidity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness\n(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated\nadmissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with\ndeterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal\ngraphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction\nfrom top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across\ninstruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high\nwhile Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing\nmode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a\ncontrolled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore\nand cover admissible explanation spaces.
