      "title": "RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback &\n  Verifiable Rewards",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM\npost-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time\nto customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry\nmodels. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to\nalign Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the\nperformance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of\nMT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).",

      "title": "SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding",
      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional\nbenchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks\nthat probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE\n(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed\nto assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:\nHuman Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,\nClustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks\nthat focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding\nthrough adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human\njudgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding\nmodels and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no\nsingle approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while\nstate-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate\nin aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical\nmetric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on\ninformation sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of\n0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers\ncritical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest\nclustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the\nlowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current\nsemantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of\nmodel robustness for real-world deployment.",

Using difference-in-means directions,\nactivation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and\ndatasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct\nlinear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently\namplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their\nrepresentational structure is consistent across model families and scales.\nThese results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,\nindependently steerable representations.",

      "summary": "Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while\nremaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in\nlow-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its\neffectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.\nWe investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized\ndatasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that\nprompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation\nin language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant\ntop-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource\nlanguages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale\nsynthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13\nIndian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an\nemphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian\ncultural contexts.

Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning\nmodels on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse\nmultilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve\nsignificant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice\nstyle NLU tasks.

      "summary": "Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise\nupdates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards\ninformation and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability\nSmoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's\nprobabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance\nratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient\nsignal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region\nthat discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.\n  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and\nQwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset\ngeneralisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO\n(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar\nperformance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise\nresponses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO\nsubstantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost\nof over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).",

      "summary": "Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing\nschemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication\noverhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness\nhinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples\nexhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level\nPP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur\nhardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP\ngranularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence\nlength distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a\nchallenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP\nscheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism\n(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource\nand workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system\nthat unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and\nworkload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short\nones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline\nschedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware\nchunk-level adaptive checkpointing.

      "summary": "The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in\nnext-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled\nheterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,\nwhich offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant\nresearch investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In\nthis work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on\noffloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips\nand traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate\nrevisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present\nSuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses\nHopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.\nSuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as\nadaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware\ncasting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace\nCPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x\nthroughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,\nenabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high\ntraining throughput.

      "summary": "The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)\nnecessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is\nlimited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are\noften generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to\naddress the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.\nCrucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the\ncharacter-level annotations required for the precise localization of\nAI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce\nLLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for\nAI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern\nproprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key\ntasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel\ntask of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level\nannotations.

      "summary": "A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response\nhomogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and\nwhether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.\nFor instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the\nfinal answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,\nfor creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components\n(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity\nproduced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output\nhomogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.\nWe address this gap in the literature directly by making the following\ncontributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task\ncategories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.\n(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output\nhomogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that\nincreases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is\nundesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We\nchallenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by\nincreasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality.

      "title": "Grounding AI Explanations in Experience: A Reflective Cognitive\n  Architecture for Clinical Decision Support",
      "summary": "Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of\nhigh accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing\nmachine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle\nto balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical\noutputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,\noften undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive\naccuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the\ndata, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a\nhuman expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are\nnot separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that\ndevelops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose\nthe Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates\nmultiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule\nrefinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a\ndistribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the\ndataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive\ndeeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We\nevaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The\nresults demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and\nrobustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\\% over the baseline but,\nmore importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating\nexplanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,\nhighlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision\nsupport systems.

      "summary": "Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose\nchallenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,\ndiffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which\nis known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an\nAnglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the\ntext-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous\nin the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after\ntranslation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring\nduplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using\nboth automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human\nevaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym\nduplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach\nalso effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias.

      "summary": "Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle\ntrajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras\nacross urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road\nconditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a\nrobust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface\nfor user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ninterpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment\non edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM\ninference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from\nedge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential\ndelays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we\npropose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces\ntransmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images.

Experiments on LongMemEval and\nLoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong\nbaselines in long-term conversational question answering.",
