      "title": "ARO: A New Lens On Matrix Optimization For Large Models",
      "summary": "Matrix-based optimizers have attracted growing interest for improving LLM training efficiency, with significant progress centered on orthogonalization/whitening based methods. While yielding substantial performance gains, a fundamental question arises: can we develop new paradigms beyond orthogonalization, pushing the efficiency frontier further? We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\\sim$1.35$\\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\\sim$1.15$\\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns. Finally, we discuss how ARO can be reformulated as a symmetry-aware optimizer grounded in rotational symmetries of residual streams, motivating advanced designs that enable computationally efficient exploitation of cross-layer/cross module couplings.",

      "title": "Data Science and Technology Towards AGI Part I: Tiered Data Management",
      "summary": "The development of artificial intelligence can be viewed as an evolution of data-driven learning paradigms, with successive shifts in data organization and utilization continuously driving advances in model capability. Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.",

      "title": "iGRPO: Self-Feedback-Driven LLM Reasoning",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving complex mathematical problems, yet they still fall short of producing accurate and consistent solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning.",

      "title": "Paradox of De-identification: A Critique of HIPAA Safe Harbour in the Age of LLMs",
      "summary": "Privacy is a human right that sustains patient-provider trust. Clinical notes capture a patient's private vulnerability and individuality, which are used for care coordination and research. Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, these notes are de-identified to protect patient privacy. However, Safe Harbor was designed for an era of categorical tabular data, focusing on the removal of explicit identifiers while ignoring the latent information found in correlations between identity and quasi-identifiers, which can be captured by modern LLMs. We first formalize these correlations using a causal graph, then validate it empirically through individual re-identification of patients from scrubbed notes. The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone. This position paper raises the question of how we can act as a community to uphold patient-provider trust when de-identification is inherently imperfect. We aim to raise awareness and discuss actionable recommendations.",

      "summary": "While there is rapid progress in video-LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities, prior work shows that these models struggle on the challenging task of sports feedback generation and require expensive and difficult-to-collect finetuning feedback data for each sport. This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations.",

Despite its relevance, research remains limited and text-based, leaving key questions unresolved about leveraging audio information, handling ASR errors, and transcript-free evaluation. We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio.",

      "summary": "Understanding an agent's goals helps explain and predict its behaviour, yet there is no established methodology for reliably attributing goals to agentic systems. We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on test-time scaling via parallel decoding (for example, 512 samples) to boost reasoning accuracy, but this incurs substantial compute. We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.",

      "summary": "LLM failures in causal reasoning, including sycophancy, rung collapse, and miscalibrated refusal, are well-documented, yet progress on remediation is slow because no benchmark enables systematic diagnosis. We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

      "summary": "AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol. Code and evaluation pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/StealthRL.",

      "summary": "Multi-hop all-reduce is the de facto backbone of large model training. As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are partially summed multiple times along their aggregation topology.\n  This paper presents DynamiQ, a quantization framework that bridges the gap between quantization best practices and multi-hop aggregation. DynamiQ introduces novel techniques to better represent partial sums, co-designed with a decompress-accumulate-recompress fused kernel to facilitate fast execution.\n  We extended PyTorch DDP to support DynamiQ over NCCL P2P, and across different LLMs, tasks, and scales, we demonstrate consistent improvement of up to 34.2% over the best among state-of-the-art methods such as Omni-Reduce, THC, and emerging standards such as MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8. Further, DynamiQ is the only evaluated method that consistently reaches near-baseline accuracy (e.g., 99.9% of the BF16 baseline) and does so while significantly accelerating the training.",

We present an automated, domain-adaptive QE framework that builds in-domain exemplar pools by harvesting pseudo-relevant passages using a BM25-MonoT5 pipeline. A training-free cluster-based strategy selects diverse demonstrations, yielding strong and stable in-context QE without supervision. To further exploit model complementarity, we introduce a two-LLM ensemble in which two heterogeneous LLMs independently generate expansions and a refinement LLM consolidates them into one coherent expansion. Across TREC DL20, DBPedia, and SciFact, the refined ensemble delivers consistent and statistically significant gains over BM25, Rocchio, zero-shot, and fixed few-shot baselines. The framework offers a reproducible testbed for exemplar selection and multi-LLM generation, and a practical, label-free solution for real-world QE.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can memorize and reproduce training sequences verbatim -- a tendency that undermines both generalization and privacy. Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives. Furthermore, we provide new theoretical insights into the geometry of memorization in neural representations.",

      "summary": "Academic peer review remains the cornerstone of scholarly validation, yet the field faces some challenges in data and methods. From the data perspective, existing research is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, verified benchmarks and oversimplified evaluation metrics that fail to reflect real-world editorial workflows. To bridge this gap, we present OmniReview, a comprehensive dataset constructed by integrating multi-source academic platforms encompassing comprehensive scholarly profiles through the disambiguation pipeline, yielding 202, 756 verified review records. Based on this data, we introduce a three-tier hierarchical evaluaion framework to assess recommendations from recall to precise expert identification. From the method perspective, existing embedding-based approaches suffer from the information bottleneck of semantic compression and limited interpretability. To resolve these method limitations, we propose Profiling Scholars with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (Pro-MMoE), a novel framework that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-task Learning. Specifically, it utilizes LLM-generated semantic profiles to preserve fine-grained expertise nuances and interpretability, while employing a Task-Adaptive MMoE architecture to dynamically balance conflicting evaluation goals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Pro-MMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across six of seven metrics, establishing a new benchmark for realistic reviewer recommendation.",

      "summary": "Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further opened the door to new forms of personalized scaffolding in education. In this study, we combine both worlds and study three types of AI-based scaffolding designs in a serious game: (i) no scaffolding, (ii) chat-based (verbal) scaffolding provided by an AI-based non-player character (NPC), and (iii) combined chat-(verbal) and action-based (visual) scaffolding in which the AI may both try to explain or demonstrate the next step towards a solution. The scaffolding conditions are embedded in Qookies, a serious game designed to introduce fundamental concepts of quantum technologies. A total of 152 school students, university students, and members of the general public were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that all groups experience significant learning gains, confirming the overall effectiveness of the serious game itself. No significant differences in learning outcomes emerged between scaffolding conditions. However, intrinsic cognitive load was lower in the combined chat-and-action (verbal+visual) scaffolding condition compared to the chat (verbal)-only condition, suggesting that visual demonstrations may offer more accessible support. Interaction analyses further revealed that players engaged with the AI character primarily for level-related questions and action recommendations, while deeper interactions were relatively rare.",

The gold standard - the Delphi method - produces calibrated, auditable judgments but requires months of coordination and specialist time, placing rigorous risk assessment out of reach for most applications. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes.",

We applied it to projects in two small companies, where we compared LLM-based quality assessments with expert judgments. Experts also participated in walkthroughs of the solution, provided feedback, and rated their acceptance of the approach. Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments. Experts recognized the usefulness of the approach but criticized the lack of integration into their workflow.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly combine long-context processing with advanced reasoning, enabling them to retrieve and synthesize information distributed across tens of thousands of tokens. A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.",

We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix.
