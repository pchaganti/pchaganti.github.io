      "title": "Mind the Gap: Bridging Thought Leap for Improved Chain-of-Thought Tuning",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on\nmathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing\nmathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts\nomitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and\ngeneralization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to\nautomatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to\nrestore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we\nconstructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the\nstructured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought\nleaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently\noutperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to\n+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)\nand provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),\nfunctioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization\ntechniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to\nout-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning\ncompleteness yields broadly applicable benefits.",

      "title": "UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in\n  Large Language Models",
      "summary": "Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving\ninformation by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system\nshould support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing\ncapabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a\npromising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to\nrevise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made\nnotable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong\nadaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally\nnew editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it\nparticularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.\nULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely\non lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling\nfast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve\nscalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization\nstrategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it\nto adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT\nachieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3\nthe VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a\n24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest\ndataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that\nour method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.\nComprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT\nconsistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing\nscenarios.

      "title": "Visionary-R1: Mitigating Shortcuts in Visual Reasoning with\n  Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging\nproblem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as\nDeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can\nenable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple\nquestion-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models\n(VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and\nvisual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)\nsupervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning\nto a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before\nproviding an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy\nquestions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data\ndistributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to\nencourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train\nthe model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially\ngenerating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an\nextensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer\npairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1,\noutperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and\nGemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.",

      "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has been paralleled by\nunprecedented increases in computational demands, with training costs for\nstate-of-the-art models doubling every few months. Training models directly in\nlow-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational\nthroughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell\narchitecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4\nvariants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for\ntraining LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often\nrely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nhardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling\naccurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.\nlinear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations\non Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies\nperformance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a\n\"near-optimal\" low-precision training technique in terms of\naccuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized\nCUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training\nbillion-scale models.

While promising, existing\nproactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed\nenvironments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based\nproactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and\nlimited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce\nContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates\nextensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.\nContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory\nperceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.\nContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from\nhistorical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive\nassistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary\ntools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate\nContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive\nLLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty\ntools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms\nbaselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive\npredictions and tool calling, respectively.

      "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem\nsolving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs\nwhen exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce\nharmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant\ntrade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated\njailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight\nalignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at\nthe start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the\nrest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while\nmaintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful\nresponses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than\nDirect Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot\nvariant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to\nreasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer\nAI.",

      "summary": "LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large\ncollections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have\nenabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of\nsemantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with\nnatural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters,\njoins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction,\nsummarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved\nstrong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An\noptimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each\nsemantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing\noptimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most\n(if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to\nconstraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an\nextensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of\na semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization\nobjective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of\nvalidation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator\nperformance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the\nbiomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering\n(MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2%\nbetter quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next\nbest system.",

In this paper, we introduce\nCost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings\nexplicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push\nthe planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints\nencourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1,\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their\nperformance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs\nsuch as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently\ndelivers strong performance, achieving higher task success rates and better\ncost efficiency.

      "summary": "While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they\noften struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering\nbrief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises\nlargely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in\nreal-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of\nresponse types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on\nsubtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we\nintroduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational\nvideos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.\nThis dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic\ninteractions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal\nLLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual\ncontext to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is\nappropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x\nimprovement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These\nresults underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,\nnatural, and engaging conversational AI.",

Despite these advancements, current works for LLM\nreasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data\nabundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability\nand generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often\nhave diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we\npropose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM\nreasoning capabilities across diverse domains.

In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the\nfirst kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform\nthinking based on the contextual information of user queries.

Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of\nrewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze\na widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct\nmodel outputs.

      "summary": "Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and\nscalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for\napplication-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or\ndeep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from\nthe base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.\nThese biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model\ninstead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we\nintroduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed\nto maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,\nresulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by\nscoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability\ndistributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.\nThis approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned\nrepresentations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,\na naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each\ndecoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.\nTo address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU.

To facilitate the systematic study of\nthese challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the\ncapabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,\na knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are\ngrounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate\ntruthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we\ndemonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an\neffective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of\nLLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying\ntruthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery.
