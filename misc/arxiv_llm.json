      "title": "BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data\n  Generation",
      "summary": "Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress\nof computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\nthe project page.",

      "title": "ArenaBencher: Automatic Benchmark Evolution via Multi-Model Competitive\n  Evaluation",
      "summary": "Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models\nand guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining\ncorpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather\nthan demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts\ncross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,\na model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test\ncases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse\npool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each\ntest case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original\nobjective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and\naggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose\nshared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations\nthat steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply\nArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains\nand show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new\nfailure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,\nand improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to\ncontinuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation\nmodels.",

      "title": "NaViL: Rethinking Scaling Properties of Native Multimodal Large Language\n  Models under Data Constraints",
      "summary": "Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected\nwith pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the\nmultimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due\nto the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of\nMLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and\nscaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through\ncareful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal\nmeta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,\nwe further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the\npositively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.\nBased on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a\nsimple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal\nbenchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.\nBesides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future\nstudy of native MLLMs.",

      "title": "Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion\n  Policy Optimization",
      "summary": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation\nwith iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)\nfine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable\nlikelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level\nlikelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this\napproach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in\nsequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a\nsurrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods\nhave seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood\nevaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its\nsources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through\nfast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{Group Diffusion Policy\nOptimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages\nsimple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the\nvariance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo\nsampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation\nbudgets.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving\nup the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with\ndistinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a\nmemory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes\nprefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving\ncosts.\n  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting\na less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct\ncharacteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have\nlarger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed\nDecode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared\nto modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%\nhigher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the\nproposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.\n  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware\ncost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while\noffering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can\nreallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%\nlower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple\nbinary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant\nempirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been\nlacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its\ntraining process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.\nCentral to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes\nthe direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the\nresponse space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the\nupdate direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size\nthreshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning\nconverges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts\nhow the critical step size must scale with response length and the success\nrate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization\nimprove stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success\nrate can stagnate strictly below $100\\%$. We validate these predictions through\ncontrolled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training\nQwen2.5-7B with GRPO.",

      "summary": "Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model\n(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.\nRecent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning\n(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of\ninteraction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number\nand diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and\neffective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.",

      "title": "CaRT: Teaching LLM Agents to Know When They Know Enough",
      "summary": "Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant\ninformation over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a\ntask. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general\nprogramming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios\nsuch as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends\nheavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply\ngenerating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack\nfine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or\ntree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical\nlinks. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based\ncoding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior\nguidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS\nretains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure\ninto the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical\ntrajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and\ncollaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design\nimproves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench\nshows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous\ndimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under\na 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

      "title": "To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large\n  Vision-Language Models",
      "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.",

We explore and validate a similar idea in our\ncommunication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control\nthe models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This\nmethod introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with\nexamples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We\nshow that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,\nincorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We\ndiscover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via\nself-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in\nnatural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of\nincorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful\nanswers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:\nwe insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it\ncontrols the target concept.
