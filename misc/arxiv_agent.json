      "title": "Context-aware LLM-based AI Agents for Human-centered Energy Management Systems in Smart Buildings",
      "summary": "This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.",

      "title": "EF(X) Orientations: A Parameterized Complexity Perspective",
      "summary": "The concept of fair orientations in graphs was introduced by Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa in 2023, naturally modeling fair division scenarios in which resources are only contested by neighbors. In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.",

With the ever-growing utilization of memes in expressing depressive sentiments, we conduct a study on identifying depressive symptoms exhibited by memes shared by users of online social media platforms. We introduce RESTOREx as a vital resource for detecting depressive symptoms in memes on social media through the Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-annotated explanations. We introduce MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies.

      "title": "DarkEQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Embodied Question Answering in Low-Light Indoor Environments",
      "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.",

      "title": "ShowUI-$π$: Flow-based Generative Models as GUI Dexterous Hands",
      "summary": "Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.",

      "title": "Semi-overlapping Multi-bandit Best Arm Identification for Sequential Support Network Learning",
      "summary": "Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

      "title": "AMAP Agentic Planning Technical Report",
      "summary": "We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.",

      "title": "Interaction of a Vortex Pair with a Polymeric Fluid Layer",
      "summary": "The interaction of vortical structures with boundaries has been extensively studied in Newtonian fluids, where conditions such as no slip walls, free surfaces, or contaminated surfaces dictate whether vortices rebound, dissipate, or generate secondary structures. In this work, we investigate a related but fundamentally different problem: the interaction of a vortex pair with a finite, non uniform layer of polymeric fluid. Numerical simulations employing the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic Peterlin model are used to examine the effects of polymer concentration, relaxation time, polymer layer thickness, and maximum polymer extension on the evolution of kinetic energy and enstrophy. The results show that, while the polymeric fluid dissipates vortical motion, vortex polymer layer interactions can also generate new coherent structures. In particular, the formation of secondary and tertiary vortices coincides with transient increases in kinetic energy, a behavior absent in the Newtonian case. Unlike classical vortex boundary interactions, where the primary vortex survives, we find that under certain conditions it completely dissipates upon interaction with the polymer layer. These findings emphasize that fluids with non-uniform polymer concentrations, act not only as dissipative agents but also as sources of vorticity, extending the traditional view of polymer induced drag reduction and providing new insight into vortex polymer interactions.",

      "title": "Fair Committee Selection under Ordinal Preferences and Limited Cardinal Information",
      "summary": "We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \\emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.\n  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \\log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries.",

      "summary": "Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.",

      "title": "BEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts",
      "summary": "Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.",

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.",

      "title": "VLN-MME: Diagnosing MLLMs as Language-guided Visual Navigation agents",
      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.",

Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.",

      "title": "Discovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics",
      "summary": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.",

Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains.

      "summary": "This paper investigates the output synchronization problem for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to distinct communication delays. The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism of distributed predictors, which enables the recursive reconstruction of future state information across the communication network. Building upon these predictors, we construct prediction-based distributed observers and formulate both prediction-based distributed state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed strategy eliminates the impact of delays after a finite number of steps, ensuring output synchronization. The effectiveness of the methods is validated through a numerical example and a Koopman operator-based linear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Notably, for a population of 4 million, the proposed delay compensation strategy achieves a reduction of over 200,000 infected individuals at the peak, underscoring its potential significance in epidemic mitigation.",

      "summary": "Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.",

      "summary": "This paper proposes a deterministic distributed algorithm, referred to as PP-ACDC, that achieves exact average consensus over possibly unbalanced directed graphs using only a fixed and a priori specified number of quantization bits. The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $ε$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.",
