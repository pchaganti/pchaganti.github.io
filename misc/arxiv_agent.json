      "title": "Lost in the Haystack: Smaller Needles are More Difficult for LLMs to\n  Find",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with\nneedle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information (\"the needle\") must be\ndrawn from a large pool of irrelevant context (\"the haystack\"). Previous\nstudies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical\nfactors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has\nreceived little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how\nvariations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context\nquestion answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops\nsharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts\nconsistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,\nposing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,\nfine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three\ndiverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical\nreasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.\nOur work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware\nLLM-driven systems.",

      "title": "Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion\n  models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading",
      "summary": "We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo\nalgorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and\nreacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based\ncomputer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate\nand beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring\nmuch prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of\nsimulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic\nfeatures of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated\ndata analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical\nproperties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical\ninvestigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as\nstochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify\nhow interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in\nbottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In\naddition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo\nsimulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis\ntools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for\navoiding them.",

      "title": "Gaming Tool Preferences in Agentic LLMs",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools,\nthanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their\nabilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text\ndescriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is\nsurprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent\ntool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool\ndescriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs\nwhen competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that\ntools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from\nGPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further\nevaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly\nwith one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set\nof 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful\nway to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation\nfor agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.",

      "title": "ProgRM: Build Better GUI Agents with Progress Rewards",
      "summary": "LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can\npotentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based\nGUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the\ndifficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works\nhave been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to\noffer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model\n(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can\nover-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,\nwe propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative\nintermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in\nonline training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,\nwe further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)\nself-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign\nprogress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and\nanalyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and\nORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for\nexperiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

      "title": "Facility Location with Public Locations and Private Doubly-Peaked Costs",
      "summary": "In the facility location problem, the task is to place one or more facilities\nso as to minimize the sum of the agent costs for accessing their nearest\nfacility. Heretofore, in the strategic version, agent locations have been\nassumed to be private, while their cost measures have been public and\nidentical.\n  For the most part, the cost measure has been the distance to the nearest\nfacility.\n  However, in multiple natural settings, such as placing a firehouse or a\nschool, this modeling does not appear to be a good fit. For it seems natural\nthat the agent locations would be known, but their costs might be private\ninformation. In addition, for these types of settings, agents may well want the\nnearest facility to be at the right distance: near, but not too near. This is\ncaptured by the doubly-peaked cost introduced by Filos-Ratsikas et al. (AAMAS\n2017).\n  In this paper, we re-examine the facility location problem from this\nperspective: known agent locations and private preferred distances to the\nnearest facility.\n  We then give lower and upper bounds on achievable approximations, focusing on\nthe problem in 1D, and in 2D with an $L_1$ distance measure.",

      "title": "ManuSearch: Democratizing Deep Search in Large Language Models with a\n  Transparent and Open Multi-Agent Framework",
      "summary": "Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited\nstrong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are\nmostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work,\nwe propose \\textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework\ndesigned to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search\nand reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning\nagent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent\nthat retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a\nstructured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web\ncontent. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce\n\\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over\nlong-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results\nshow that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and\neven surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for\nreproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the\ndata and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch",

      "title": "Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline\n  Goal-Conditioned RL",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and\ndialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and\npersuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning.\nReinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle,\nbut suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn\nRL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated\nwhen training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the\nAPIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to\nimprove the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather\nthan RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses\ngoal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that\nscales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task\nwill unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple\npossible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In\naddition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than\nfull actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates\ndecision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks\nrequiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue,\ndemonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting\nmethods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.",

      "title": "Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video\n  Understanding",
      "summary": "Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to\nextensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering\nunder such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long\ncontext handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing\ninformation-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose\nthe Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over\nsegmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing\na rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By\nproviding a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our\nDVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its\ncurrent observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate\nparameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light\nof the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple\nlong video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the\nentire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly\nsurpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.\nComprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided,\nyielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form\nvideo understanding tasks. The code will be released later.",

      "title": "Linear Mixture Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes",
      "summary": "Many real-world decision-making problems face the off-dynamics challenge: the\nagent learns a policy in a source domain and deploys it in a target domain with\ndifferent state transitions. The distributionally robust Markov decision\nprocess (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that\nperforms well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified\nuncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the\nproper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the\ndynamics. In this work, we propose a novel linear mixture DRMDP framework,\nwhere the nominal dynamics is assumed to be a linear mixture model. In contrast\nwith existing uncertainty sets directly defined as a ball centered around the\nnominal kernel, linear mixture DRMDPs define the uncertainty sets based on a\nball around the mixture weighting parameter. We show that this new framework\nprovides a more refined representation of uncertainties compared to\nconventional models based on $(s,a)$-rectangularity and $d$-rectangularity,\nwhen prior knowledge about the mixture model is present. We propose a meta\nalgorithm for robust policy learning in linear mixture DRMDPs with general\n$f$-divergence defined uncertainty sets, and analyze its sample complexities\nunder three divergence metrics instantiations: total variation,\nKullback-Leibler, and $\\chi^2$ divergences. These results establish the\nstatistical learnability of linear mixture DRMDPs, laying the theoretical\nfoundation for future research on this new setting.",

      "title": "Towards Analyzing and Understanding the Limitations of VAPO: A\n  Theoretical Perspective",
      "summary": "The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in\nenhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By\nsystematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous\nsequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical\nunderstanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial\nfor guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion\nby exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its\nassumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield\nmore robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies\nof value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of\nadaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the\nenduring challenges of exploration and generalization.",
