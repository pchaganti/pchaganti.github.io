      "title": "AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science",
      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing\nreal-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to\nautomate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world\neffectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined\nworkflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on\nrelatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical\nexpertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this\nwork, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework\nthat overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated\nexpert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an\nagentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores\npossible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically\ntailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data\nscience benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance\nversus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable\neffectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting\nAutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.",

      "title": "Eye, Robot: Learning to Look to Act with a BC-RL Perception-Action Loop",
      "summary": "Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order\nto act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system\nwith gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We\ndevelop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings\nand train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest\nEyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate\nmanipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

      "title": "SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data\n  and Evaluation Benchmarks",
      "summary": "Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is\ncrucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

      "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal\ncounterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI\nsystems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web\nenvironments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web\ninteractions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the\nfundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.\nCurrent methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether\nprocessing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional\ninformation, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.\nThis position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:\nrather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we\nshould develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic\ncapabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface\n(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We\nestablish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,\nefficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary\nstakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of\nexisting interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and\ntransparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving\nthe broader ML community.",

      "title": "Monitoring Decomposition Attacks in LLMs with Lightweight Sequential\n  Monitors",
      "summary": "Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a\nmalicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The\nchallenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only\ndetect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,\nleaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of\nseemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be\ninjected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.\nTo defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring\nframework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully\nprompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,\nbeating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust\nagainst random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our\nfindings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in\nmitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.",

      "title": "Execution Guided Line-by-Line Code Generation",
      "summary": "We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates\nreal-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation\ncapabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during\ninference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our\nmethod, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically\nincorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing\nline-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable\nsolutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search\nto sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract\nexecution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and\nfinally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By\nmaintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and\nrefreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance\nwhile preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports\nnative parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in\nparallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad\nset of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks\ndemonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance\ncompared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across\nvarious levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging\ncompetitive programming tasks.

      "summary": "Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human\npreferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative\nscenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of\n\"epistemic friction,\" or the inherent resistance encountered when updating\nbeliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this\npaper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic\nintegration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current\nbelief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position\nthis within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,\n2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the\ninteraction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that\ndemonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief\nupdates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief\nalignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be\nmade more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue\nscenarios.",

      "summary": "In densely-packed two-dimensional systems of growing cells, such as\nrod-shaped bacteria, a number of experimental and numerical studies report\ndistinct patterns of nematic orientational order in the presence of\nconfinement. So far, these effects have been explained using variations of\ngrowing active nematic continuum theories, which incorporate feedback between\ngrowth-induced active stresses, the resulting material flow and nematic\norientation, and were adapted to the specific geometry under investigation.\nHere, we first show that a direct, analytical prediction of orientation\npatterns based on a simple isotropic-growth assumption and the shear rate\ntensor of the expansion flow already covers previously observed cases. We use\nthis method to tune orientation patterns and net topological defect charge in a\nsystematic way using domain geometry, confirmed by agent-based simulations. We\nthen show how this framework can be extended to quantitatively capture\nalignment strength, and explore its potential for cross-prediction across\ndifferent geometries. Our simplified and unifying theoretical framework\nhighlights the role of domain geometry in shaping nematic order of growing\nsystems, and thereby provides a way to forward-engineer desired orientation\npatterns.",

It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks\nrequires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual\nperception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we\nchallenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic\nframework for long video understanding.

Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical\ncomponents: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to\ngenerate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in\nReviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot\nanimation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level\nconsistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering\neach clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips.
