      "title": "ComputerRL: Scaling End-to-End Online Reinforcement Learning for\n  Computer Use Agents",
      "summary": "We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that\nenables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL\nfeatures the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct\nGUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and\nhuman-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial\nfor improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains\nchallenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended\ntraining. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL\ninfrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop\nenvironments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose\nEntropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with\nsupervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended\ntraining runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and\nQwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B\nbased on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,\ndemonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop\nautomation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et\nal., 2024a)",

      "title": "Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation",
      "summary": "Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into\nagentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to\nsolve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that\nprefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance\ngains.

      "summary": "Audio comprehension-including speech, non-speech sounds, and music-is\nessential for achieving human-level intelligence. Consequently, AI agents must\ndemonstrate holistic audio understanding to qualify as generally intelligent.\nHowever, evaluating auditory intelligence comprehensively remains challenging.\nTo address this gap, we introduce MMAU-Pro, the most comprehensive and\nrigorously curated benchmark for assessing audio intelligence in AI systems.\nMMAU-Pro contains 5,305 instances, where each instance has one or more audios\npaired with human expert-generated question-answer pairs, spanning speech,\nsound, music, and their combinations. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro\nevaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex\ndimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning,\nmulti-audio understanding, among others. All questions are meticulously\ndesigned to require deliberate multi-hop reasoning, including both\nmultiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Importantly, audio data is\nsourced directly ``from the wild\" rather than from existing datasets with known\ndistributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI\nmodels, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as\nGemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy,\nrespectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories. Our\nextensive analysis highlights specific shortcomings and provides novel\ninsights, offering actionable perspectives for the community to enhance future\nAI systems' progression toward audio general intelligence.

      "summary": "As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering\ntrustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective\nand safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must\npromote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or\novertrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,\nHRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and\navoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical\nconcerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for\nbuilding trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We\nemphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the\nrobot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate\nits intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,\nrobots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs\nwhile providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over\ntheir actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important\nfor bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true\ncapabilities.",

      "summary": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily\nlife, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to\napply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.\nPrior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach\nstudents the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this\nneed, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting\nliteracy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with\ndirect interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary\nschool students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two\niterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education\nclassrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'\nprompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and\n3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the\nAI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory\nquality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in\nimproving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in\ntheir perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1\ninformed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and\ndiscrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could\nmeasure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for\nour target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for\nbroader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess\nlearning effectiveness and assessment design.",

      "title": "A Mechanism for Mutual Fairness in Cooperative Games with Replicable\n  Resources -- Extended Version",
      "summary": "The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and\nhuman agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each\nbenefits equally from the participation of the other.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nintroduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these\nsimulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions.\nThis paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based\nsimulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more\nrealistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore,\nour system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant,\npersonalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated\nencounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's\nreal-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy.\nPreliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and\ncoherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and\nappropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments.

      "summary": "The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical\nquestions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates\nthese dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a\nsystem famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct\ncomputational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate\ntheir behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the \"collaboration\nparadox\": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior\ncollaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)\nprinciples, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this\nparadox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving\nthe system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis\nof two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to\nestablish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution\nprotocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our\nfinal framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,\nevaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work\nprovides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI\nagents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems\nfor business analytics.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in\ntheir application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating\ndevice management through natural language instructions. However, existing\ncentralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing\nand coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities\nin large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a\ndistributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges\nthrough lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based\nmachine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled\nautomation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate\ndevice-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0\ndistributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs\nembedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions\ninto simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then\nprocessed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at\nthe associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers\nby using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless\ncollaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system\nincorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for\nreliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution\nframework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and\nreal-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in\nscalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized\napproach.",

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline\nmodel development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to\ndomain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory\nmanagement, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible\nworkflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \\textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular\nagentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling\nworkflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a\nstructured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,\ncode refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and\nexperimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped\nwith structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement\nstrategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and\nreducing error propagation. \\textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,\nrobust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes\nenvironments such as financial services.

      "summary": "This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the\nDC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the\nconvergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.\nWe derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency\non the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy.

However, current agentic ecosystems remain\nfragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for\nAgentic AI has become a critical prerequisite.

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration.

      "title": "Self-Organizing Agent Network for LLM-based Workflow Automation",
      "summary": "Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in\nreal-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed\nthrough modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in\nintricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths.\nSuch complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as\nextended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning\neffectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore,\ndeveloping an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of\nhandling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we\npropose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent\nNetwork (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by\nidentifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing\nmodularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed\nusing multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and\nexecution efficiency.",
