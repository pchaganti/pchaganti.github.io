      "title": "Agentic Design of Compositional Machines",
      "summary": "The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence\nand a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.",
