      "title": "Are Conversational AI Agents the Way Out? Co-Designing Reader-Oriented News Experiences with Immigrants and Journalists",
      "summary": "Recent discussions at the intersection of journalism, HCI, and human-centered computing ask how technologies can help create reader-oriented news experiences. The current paper takes up this initiative by focusing on immigrant readers, a group who reports significant difficulties engaging with mainstream news yet has received limited attention in prior research. We report findings from our co-design research with eleven immigrant readers living in the United States and seven journalists working in the same region, aiming to enhance the news experience of the former. Data collected from all participants revealed an \"unaddressed-or-unaccountable\" paradox that challenges value alignment across immigrant readers and journalists. This paradox points to four metaphors regarding how conversational AI agents can be designed to assist news reading. Each metaphor requires conversational AI, journalists, and immigrant readers to coordinate their shared responsibilities in a distinct manner. These findings provide insights into reader-oriented news experiences with AI in the loop.",

      "title": "$α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks",
      "summary": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.\n  We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).\n  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench",

      "summary": "The automatic generation of pull requests (PRs) using AI agents has become increasingly common. Although AI-generated PRs are fast and easy to create, their merge rates have been reported to be lower than those created by humans. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 40,214 PRs collected from the AIDev dataset. We extract 64 features across six families and fit statistical regression models to compare PR merge outcomes for human and agentic PRs, as well as across three AI agents. Our results show that submitter attributes dominate merge outcomes for both groups, while review-related features exhibit contrasting effects between human and agentic PRs. The findings of this study provide insights into improving PR quality through human-AI collaboration.",

      "title": "Why Keep Your Doubts to Yourself? Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems",
      "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination. We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x. These results establish market-based coordination as a principled and scalable paradigm for building economically viable multi-agent visual intelligence systems.",

As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.",

However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.",

      "summary": "Large language models deployed as autonomous agents face critical memory limitations, lacking selective forgetting mechanisms that lead to either catastrophic forgetting at context boundaries or information overload within them. While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.",

      "title": "Vaccine Efficacy Estimands Implied by Common Estimators Used in Individual Randomized Field Trials",
      "summary": "We review vaccine efficacy (VE) estimands for susceptibility in individual randomized trials with natural (unmeasured) exposure, where individual responses are measured as time from vaccination until an event (e.g., disease from the infectious agent). Common VE estimands are written as $1-θ$, where $θ$ is some ratio effect measure (e.g., ratio of incidence rates, cumulative incidences, hazards, or odds) comparing outcomes under vaccination versus control. Although the ratio effects are approximately equal with low control event rates, we explore the quality of that approximation using a nonparametric formulation. Traditionally, the primary endpoint VE estimands are full immunization (or biological) estimands that represent a subset of the intent-to-treat population, excluding those that have the event before the vaccine has been able to ramp-up to its full effect, requiring care for proper causal interpretation. Besides these primary VE estimands that summarize an effect of the vaccine over the full course of the study, we also consider local VE estimands that measure the effect at particular time points. We discuss interpretational difficulties of local VE estimands (e.g., depletion of susceptibles bias), and using frailty models as sensitivity analyses for the individual-level causal effects over time.",

      "summary": "Parallelization in Reinforcement Learning is typically employed to speed up the training of a single policy, where multiple workers collect experience from an identical sampling distribution. This common design limits the potential of parallelization by neglecting the advantages of diverse exploration strategies. We propose K-Myriad, a scalable and unsupervised method that maximizes the collective state entropy induced by a population of parallel policies. By cultivating a portfolio of specialized exploration strategies, K-Myriad provides a robust initialization for Reinforcement Learning, leading to both higher training efficiency and the discovery of heterogeneous solutions. Experiments on high-dimensional continuous control tasks, with large-scale parallelization, demonstrate that K-Myriad can learn a broad set of distinct policies, highlighting its effectiveness for collective exploration and paving the way towards novel parallelization strategies.",

      "title": "Stable Matching with Deviators and Conformists",
      "summary": "In the fundamental Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates problems, there are inherent trade-offs between the size and stability of solutions. While in the former problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently using the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm, the existence of a stable matching is not guaranteed in the latter problem, but can be determined efficiently using Irving's algorithm. However, the computation of matchings that minimise the instability, either due to the presence of additional constraints on the size of the matching or due to restrictive preference cycles, gives rise to a collection of infamously intractable almost-stable matching problems. In practice, however, not every agent is able or likely to initiate deviations caused by blocking pairs. Suppose we knew, for example, due to a set of requirements or estimates based on historical data, which agents are likely to initiate deviations - the deviators - and which are likely to comply with whatever matching they are presented with - the conformists. Can we decide efficiently whether a matching exists in which no deviator is blocking, i.e., in which no deviator has an incentive to initiate a deviation? Furthermore, can we find matchings in which only a few deviators are blocking? We characterise the computational complexity of this question in bipartite and non-bipartite preference settings. Surprisingly, these problems prove computationally intractable in strong ways: for example, unlike in the classical setting, where every agent is considered a deviator, in this extension, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists where no deviator is blocking. On the positive side, we identify polynomial-time and fixed-parameter tractable cases, providing novel algorithmics for multi-agent systems where stability cannot be fully guaranteed.",

      "title": "An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks",
      "summary": "With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an \"Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute\" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.",

      "title": "GenAgent: Scaling Text-to-Image Generation via Agentic Multimodal Reasoning",
      "summary": "We introduce GenAgent, unifying visual understanding and generation through an agentic multimodal model. Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\\%) and WISE (+14\\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

      "summary": "Field education is the signature pedagogy of social work, yet providing timely and objective feedback during training is constrained by the availability of instructors and counseling clients. In this paper, we present SWITCH, the Social Work Interactive Training Chatbot. SWITCH integrates realistic client simulation, real-time counseling skill classification, and a Motivational Interviewing (MI) progression system into the training workflow. To model a client, SWITCH uses a cognitively grounded profile comprising static fields (e.g., background, beliefs) and dynamic fields (e.g., emotions, automatic thoughts, openness), allowing the agent's behavior to evolve throughout a session realistically. The skill classification module identifies the counseling skills from the user utterances, and feeds the result to the MI controller that regulates the MI stage transitions. To enhance classification accuracy, we study in-context learning with retrieval over annotated transcripts, and a fine-tuned BERT multi-label classifier. In the experiments, we demonstrated that both BERT-based approach and in-context learning outperforms the baseline with big margin. SWITCH thereby offers a scalable, low-cost, and consistent training workflow that complements field education, and allows supervisors to focus on higher-level mentorship.",

      "summary": "While Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at general tasks, they inherently struggle with continual adaptation due to the frozen weights after deployment. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents.

      "title": "DEEPMED: Building a Medical DeepResearch Agent via Multi-hop Med-Search Data and Turn-Controlled Agentic Training & Inference",
      "summary": "Medical reasoning models remain constrained by parametric knowledge and are thus susceptible to forgetting and hallucinations. DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.",

      "summary": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.",

Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios.

While offline training offers a more efficient alternative, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality research trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs. Leveraging these resources, we train OffSeeker (8B), a model developed entirely offline.

While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).
