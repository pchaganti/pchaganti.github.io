      "title": "Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning Capabilities in Large\n  Language Models",
      "summary": "While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static\nbenchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and\nreasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study\nsystematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,\nand planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of\nagents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in\ndynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller\nones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a\ntoo-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,\nwhile larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting\ntechniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less\nimprovement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find\nthat advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable\nof significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making\nalign, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.\nCompared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true\nemergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits\npersistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and\nspatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models\nstill suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through\nself-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while\nreasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math\nword problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important\nshortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move\nbeyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.",

      "title": "Knowledge capture, adaptation and composition (KCAC): A framework for\n  cross-task curriculum learning in robotic manipulation",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic\nmanipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of\ninterpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling\nthe agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse\nworking scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key\nfactor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,\nand Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer\ninto RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two\nblock stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic\nmanipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to\nsolve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In\nthis work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid\nconstraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards\nconcurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two\nself-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to\nfacilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40\npercent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10\npercent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we\nidentify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,\nand learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual\nguidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights\ninto curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.",

      "title": "Fixing Incomplete Value Function Decomposition for Multi-Agent\n  Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent\nreinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent\nutilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action\nselection process between individual utilities and joint values remains\nconsistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the\nindividual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is\nstraightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited\nrepresentation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM\nvalues, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is\nunnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the\nfull class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a\nnovel family of value function decomposition models that expand the\nrepresentation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin \"fixing\" layer.\nWe derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two\nwell-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on\nmultiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)\nsucceeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably\nand performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this\nwhile employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.",

      "title": "Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion\n  Timesteps",
      "summary": "Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as\nrobotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills\nfrom demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the\nsub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion\npolicies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.\nWhile reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising\nsolution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to\neffectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This\nchallenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood\nestimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated\noptimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized\npolicies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much\nlower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies\n(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework\nthat reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.\nBy treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned\non pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and\ngradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when\ntraining from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency\nand final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot\ncontrol and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results\nshow that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the\nDiffusion Policy.",

      "summary": "The allocation of resources among multiple agents is a fundamental problem in\nboth economics and computer science. In these settings, fairness plays a\ncrucial role in ensuring social acceptability and practical implementation of\nresource allocation algorithms. Traditional fair division solutions have given\nrise to a variety of approximate fairness notions, often as a response to the\nchallenges posed by non-existence or computational intractability of exact\nsolutions. However, the inherent incompatibility among these notions raises a\ncritical question: which concept of fairness is most suitable for practical\napplications? In this paper, we examine two broad frameworks -- threshold-based\nand comparison-based fairness notions -- and evaluate their perceived fairness\nthrough a comprehensive human subject study. Our findings uncover novel\ninsights into the interplay between perception of fairness, theoretical\nguarantees, the role of externalities and subjective valuations, and underlying\ncognitive processes, shedding light on the theory and practice of fair\ndivision.",

The majority's\npreferences align with the ground truth, while the minorities disagree.\nFocusing on strategic behavior, we analyze situations where agents can form\ncoalitions up to a certain capacity and adopt the concept of ex-ante Bayesian\n$k$-strong equilibrium, in which no group of at most $k$ agents has an\nincentive to deviate. Our analysis provides a complete characterization of the\nregion where equilibria exist and yield the majority-preferred outcome when the\nground truth is common knowledge. This region is defined by two key parameters:\nthe size of the majority group and the maximum coalition capacity. When agents\ncannot coordinate beyond a certain threshold determined by these parameters, a\nstable outcome supporting the informed majority emerges. The boundary of this\nregion exhibits several distinct segments, notably including a surprising\nnon-linear relationship between majority size and deviation capacity. Our\nresults reveal the complexity of the strategic behaviors in this type of voting\ngame, which in turn demonstrate the capability of the ex-ante Bayesian\n$k$-strong equilibrium to provide a more detailed analysis.",

      "title": "Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable",
      "summary": "The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a\ngraph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never\nencounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called\nClassical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are\nconsidered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time\nstep. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking\ninto account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can\nbe safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of\nconflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the\nbody of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying\nstill at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how\nharder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while\nplanning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an\nundirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete\npolynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In\nthis paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard\nand, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be\npresented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of\nreducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)\nto the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we\nprocedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices\nand show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path\nfinding instance has a solution.",

      "summary": "Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations\nand act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by\nempowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial\nintelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally\nfoundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by\nwhat it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal\nagent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental\nconnection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable\ndefinition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we\ncall the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity\nstrictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while\npreserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that\nplasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to\nthe empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding\nestablishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,\nsuggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We\nexplore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,\nempowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.",

While deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal\npolicies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume\na world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,\nconventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a\nfundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when\nencountering novel environmental changes during deployment without\ncatastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation\ndemonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:\n(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and\nlearn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior\nknowledge through structured representations that can be updated without\ndisruption to reusable components.",

      "title": "Optimizing Electric Bus Charging Scheduling with Uncertainties Using\n  Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step\ntoward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,\ncharging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on\nreal-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical\nchallenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and\nfluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,\ncharging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales\nand remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a\nHierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the\noriginal Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these\nMDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL\nalgorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization\nEnhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic\n(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at\nboth decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor\nnetwork and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state\ninformation for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low\nlevel, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is\nincorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated\ncharging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing\nconvergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the\nsuperior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet\ncharging schedules.",

      "summary": "The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based\non Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is\nconceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating\nperiods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time\nsteps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse\nreward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP\ninto a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical\nDouble Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is\nproposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different\ntemporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective\npolicy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while\nthe low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of\nevery time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the\ncharging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat\npolicy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the\noptimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original\nMDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the\nnon-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the\nlow-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and\nexploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for\nboth levels of agents.
