      "title": "Deep Researcher with Sequential Plan Reflection and Candidates Crossover (Deep Researcher Reflect Evolve)",
      "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Deep Researcher architecture designed to generate detailed research reports on complex PhD level topics by addressing the inherent limitations of the Parallel Scaling paradigm. Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.",

      "title": "Idea2Story: An Automated Pipeline for Transforming Research Concepts into Complete Scientific Narratives",
      "summary": "Autonomous scientific discovery with large language model (LLM)-based agents has recently made substantial progress, demonstrating the ability to automate end-to-end research workflows. However, existing systems largely rely on runtime-centric execution paradigms, repeatedly reading, summarizing, and reasoning over large volumes of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story, a pre-computation-driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.",

      "title": "MemCtrl: Using MLLMs as Active Memory Controllers on Embodied Agents",
      "summary": "Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.",

      "title": "SERA: Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents",
      "summary": "Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.",

      "title": "Learning From a Steady Hand: A Weakly Supervised Agent for Robot Assistance under Microscopy",
      "summary": "This paper rethinks steady-hand robotic manipulation by using a weakly supervised framework that fuses calibration-aware perception with admittance control. Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.",

      "title": "Agentic Fog: A Policy-driven Framework for Distributed Intelligence in Fog Computing",
      "summary": "Fog and edge computing require adaptive control schemes that can handle partial observability, severe latency requirements, and dynamically changing workloads. Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions.",

      "title": "Continual GUI Agents",
      "summary": "As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.",

      "summary": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.",

      "summary": "We study the design of optimal allocation mechanisms in an environment where agents and goods arrive stochastically. Agents have private types that determine the principal payoff. Either agents or goods can be held in a queue at a flow cost until allocation. The principal cannot use monetary transfers, but can verify agents types at a cost. We characterize the optimal mechanism at the steady state of the system. It is a dynamic threshold mechanism in which the principal sets type thresholds for agent admission and goods allocation. These thresholds depend on the current state of the mechanism. The model applies to public programs such as public housing and grant allocation, and to allocation problems within organizations such as capital budgeting.",

      "title": "Distributed Learning over Noisy Communication Networks",
      "summary": "We study binary coordination games over graphs under log-linear learning when neighbor actions are conveyed through explicit noisy communication links. Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory and quantify the tradeoff between communication resources and steady-state coordination quality.",

      "title": "Li-ViP3D++: Query-Gated Deformable Camera-LiDAR Fusion for End-to-End Perception and Trajectory Prediction",
      "summary": "End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.",

This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation. The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.",

To address this gap, we introduce MedViz, a visual analytics system that integrates multiple AI agents with interactive visualization to support the exploration of the large-scale biomedical literature. MedViz combines a semantic map of millions of articles with agent-driven functions for querying, summarizing, and hypothesis generation, allowing researchers to iteratively refine questions, identify trends, and uncover hidden connections.

The QRL agent can explore the exponentially large scheduling space effectively by applying Grover's search to the reinforcement learning process.

      "summary": "As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.",

While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets.

Then, a sum communication rate maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the constraints of transmit power and the minimum sensing rates of users. To solve this problem, we develop a framework that leverages deep learning algorithms to provide a three-stage solution for ISAC beamforming. The three-stage beamforming optimization solution includes three modules: 1) an unsupervised learning based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract fixed-size latent features while keeping its essential information from the variable channel state information (CSI); 2) a reinforcement learning (RL) based beampattern optimization algorithm is proposed to search the desired beampattern according to the extracted features; 3) a supervised learning based beamforming reconstruction algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the beamforming vector from beampattern given by the RL agent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three-stage solution outperforms the baseline RL algorithm by optimizing the intuitional beampattern rather than beamforming.",

These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections.

Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.",

To address this challenge, we propose an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)-integrated playback framework that jointly orchestrates radio, compute, and content resources in near real time (Near-RT) control loop. The system formulates the rendered-pixel ratio as a continuous control variable and jointly optimizes it over the Open Cloud (O-Cloud) compute, gNB transmit power, and bandwidth under a Weber-Fechner quality of experience (QoE) model, explicitly balancing resolution, computation, and latency. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent with structured action decomposition and QoE-aware reward shaping resolves the resulting high-dimensional control problem. Experiments on a 5G O-RAN testbed and system simulations show that SAC reduces median MTP latency by above $11\\%$ and improves both mean QoE and fairness, demonstrating the feasibility of RIC-driven joint radio-compute-content control for scalable, latency-aware immersive streaming.",
