      "summary": "LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,\nreasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual\nreasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and\nstatic toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,\nmulti-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and\nrefine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and\ninterpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by\nPyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.\nQuantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting\nGPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.\nThese results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just\nto use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual\nreasoning.",

      "title": "OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online\n  Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding",
      "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nremarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex\nreasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To\nfoster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and\nbenchmark are available. Our project page is:\nhttps://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/",

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking",
      "summary": "We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.\nOur recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is\nto leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of\nonline learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain\ncentral challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data\nshould be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is\nthat action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where\nsequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each\ntimestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to\nmitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by\ndirectly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)\nleverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective\nonline exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and\nefficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking\nexhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming\nprior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward\nmanipulation tasks.",

      "title": "MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents",
      "summary": "Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,\nexisting solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly\nscoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,\nand reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we\nintroduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future\nof AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language\nmodels to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a\nchallenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution\ncomputer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and\nwhere no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher\naccuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.\nSecond, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual\ninput, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing\nexisting baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance\nstandard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our\nmemory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors\nthe screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers\nintuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.",

In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven\napproach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings\ncalls.

We\nevaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution\naccuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.",

      "summary": "The fragmentation of AI agent ecosystems has created urgent demands for\ninteroperability, trust, and economic coordination that current protocols --\nincluding MCP (Hou et al., 2025), A2A (Habler et al., 2025), ACP (Liu et al.,\n2025), and Cisco's AGP (Edwards, 2025) -- cannot address at scale. We present\nthe Nanda Unified Architecture, a decentralized framework built around three\ncore innovations: fast DID-based agent discovery through distributed\nregistries, semantic agent cards with verifiable credentials and composability\nprofiles, and a dynamic trust layer that integrates behavioral attestations\nwith policy compliance.

Real-world deployments demonstrate 99.9 percent compliance in\nhealthcare applications and substantial monthly transaction volumes with strong\nprivacy guarantees. By unifying MIT's trust research with production\ndeployments from Cisco and Synergetics, we show how cryptographic proofs and\npolicy-as-code transform agents into trust-anchored participants in a\ndecentralized economy (Lakshmanan, 2025; Sha, 2025).

      "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein\nstructure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high\nquality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone\nprocess. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with\npython scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation\nof MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based\ninterface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating\nGemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation\nscripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM\nGUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.\nPost processing is performed using additional software to further refine the\nsimulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free\nworkflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,\nminimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple\nprotein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader\napplication of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and\nadaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.",

This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical\ndiagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose\nDocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning\nby decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom\nelicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each\nmodule uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,\nprioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.\n  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),\nDocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and\nover 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in\ndialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in\nenabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --\npaving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual\nand resource-constrained settings.",

      "title": "\"So, Tell Me About Your Policy...\": Distillation of interpretable\n  policies from Deep Reinforcement Learning agents",
      "summary": "Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the\ninclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches\nproposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques\ndemonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other\nreal-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a\nsignificant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly\nwhen attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative\nimportance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the\npolicy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,\nit is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,\nalthough at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an\ninterpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the\npeculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the\nadvantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior\nto the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training\nof an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed\nalgorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a\nfinancial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful\ninformation from complex expert policies.",

However, these sensory\ninputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal\nrepresentation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these\nperceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation\nlearning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled\nrobot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple\nsquare environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random\nexploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite\nthese distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space\nthat correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot\nautonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit\nspatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied\ncognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated\nnavigation strategies in artificial life.",

While individual\nsuccess is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of\nRL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building\ndynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we\nformally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,\nmulti-objective building energy management task, and formulate the\nmulti-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the\nchallenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts\nsuch as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives\nsuch as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to\nparameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,\nand construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable\nRL algorithms in practical building control tasks.

Traditional graph-based models typically assume memoryless\nmovement, limiting their ability to capture sequential dependencies inherent in\nreal-world mobility patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel higher-order\nnetwork framework for modeling memory-dependent dynamics in transportation\nsystems. By extending classical graph representations through higher-order\nMarkov chains and de Bruijn graph structures, our framework encodes the spatial\nand temporal ordering of traversed paths, enabling the analysis of structurally\nand functionally critical components with improved fidelity. We generalize key\nnetwork analytics, including betweenness centrality, PageRank, and next-step\nprediction, to this higher-order setting and validate our approach on the Sioux\nFalls transportation network using agent-based trajectory data generated with\nMATSim. Experimental results demonstrate that higher-order models outperform\nfirst-order baselines across multiple tasks, with the third-order model\nachieving an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model complexity.\nThese findings highlight the importance of incorporating memory effects into\nnetwork-based transportation analysis and offer a scalable, data-driven\nmethodology for capturing complex mobility behaviors in infrastructure systems.",
