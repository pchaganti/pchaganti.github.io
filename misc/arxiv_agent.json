      "title": "Establishing Best Practices for Building Rigorous Agentic Benchmarks",
      "summary": "Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI\nagents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have\nintroduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.\nThese benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task\noutcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic\nbenchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench\nVerified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses\nas successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'\nperformance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation\nrigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of\nguidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey\nof best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a\nbenchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the\nperformance overestimation by 33%.",

      "title": "Moral Responsibility or Obedience: What Do We Want from AI?",
      "summary": "As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of\ngeneral reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices\nthat treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.\nThis paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language\nmodels (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically\nambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be\ninterpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical\nreasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental\nrationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk\nparadigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of\nartificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from\nrigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in\nsystems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk\nmischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective\ngovernance.",

      "title": "KERAP: A Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning Approach for Accurate Zero-shot\n  Diagnosis Prediction Using Multi-agent LLMs",
      "summary": "Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and\npersonalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely\nadopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their\nability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of\nacquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis\nprediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured\nmedical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we\npropose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves\nLLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our\nframework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent\nfor structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively\nrefines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP\nenhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and\ninterpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.",

      "summary": "The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers\nfor interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing\nmethods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic\nAI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and\nmethodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual\ncontext but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be\ninefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm\nfocused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed\nin natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol\n(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered\nKnowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable\nof decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This\nposition paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from\nrelated concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse\nfields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational\nmethodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.",

      "title": "Defining and classifying models of groups: The social ontology of\n  higher-order networks",
      "summary": "In complex systems research, the study of higher-order interactions has\nexploded in recent years. Researchers have formalized various types of group\ninteractions, such as public goods games, biological contagion, and information\nbroadcasting, showing how higher-order networks can capture group effects more\ndirectly than pairwise models. However, equating hyperedges-edges involving\nmore than two agents-with groups can be misleading, as it obscures the\npolysemous nature of ``group interactions''. For instance, many models of\nhigher-order interactions focus on the internal state of the hyperedge,\nspecifying dynamical rules at the group level. These models often neglect how\ninteractions with external groups can influence behaviors and dynamics within\nthe group. Yet, anthropologists and philosophers remind us that external norms,\nfactors, and forces governing intergroup behavior are essential to defining\nwithin-group dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from social\nontology relevant to the emerging physics of higher-order networks. We propose\na typology for classifying models of group interactions based on two\nperspectives. The first focuses on individuals within groups engaging in\ncollective action, where shared agency serves as the binding force. The second\nadopts a group-first approach, emphasizing institutional facts that extend\nbeyond the specific individuals involved. Building on these perspectives, we\nintroduce four dimensions to classify models of group interactions:\npersistence, coupling, reducibility, and alignment. For the physics of\nhigher-order networks, we provide a hierarchy of nested mathematical models to\nexplore the complex properties of social groups. We highlight social\ninteractions not yet explored in the literature on higher-order networks and\npropose future research avenues to foster collaboration between social ontology\nand the physics of complex systems.",

      "title": "Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis",
      "summary": "Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic\nenvironment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,\nseparation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a\nlinear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their\nlocation, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of\nwhich, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario\n(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).\nHowever, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,\nwhile making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to\nerrors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and\ncomputational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop\ntechniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives\nrise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a\nsmall computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,\nhearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this\neffect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where\nthe tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate\nfor local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to\ncorrect the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the\nlocalization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent\nauditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,\nwithout a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.\nThe complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses\nopen-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent\ncommunication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.",

Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are\ncurrently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We\nbelieve open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where\nco-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific\nprogress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we\ndevelop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in\nmodel-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We\nprovide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved\nversion of the SOTA SecAlign defense.

These\nchallenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains\nuniversity-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address\nthis, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new\nframework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the\nevolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the\nresulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our\napproach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs\nfor subgoal generation and tactic synthesis.

      "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved\nimpressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,\na tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which\nlimits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,\nhumans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,\nwhere the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the\nforgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of\nforgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and\nGrow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,\nExperience Replay Decay (ER Decay) \"forgetting early experience\", which\nbalances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.\nSecond, Network Expansion, \"growing neural capacity\", which enhances agents'\ncapability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new\nparameters during training.

In\norder to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,\nwe propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients\nwith most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore\nthe application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance\nstandpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as\n1p1v or FedAvg).

Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy\nprotocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology\nand/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model\nweights.

      "summary": "The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of\nLLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources\nto support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent\none of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication\nmedium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to\nemail using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions\nvia external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing\ndeployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains\nunderexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential\nsecurity risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of\nLLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which\noverrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,\nallowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further\nperform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.\n  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to\nevaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an\nempirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,\n12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world\nemail agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all\n1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack\nattempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some\nLLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops\nto as few as 1.23.",

      "summary": "This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can\nimprove dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts\nwhere traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that\noverlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has\napplied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain\nsingle-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply\nchains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three\nMARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,\nwithin a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and\na LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL\nagents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest\nvolatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These\nfindings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured\nby static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.",

      "title": "On the Convergence of Large Language Model Optimizer for Black-Box\n  Network Management",
      "summary": "Future wireless networks are expected to incorporate diverse services that\noften lack general mathematical models. To address such black-box network\nmanagement tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which\nleverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as\na promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts\ndescribing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated\nby LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions\nautonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective\nfunctions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has\nbeen studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to\nnumerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference\nsteps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and\nprove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more\nadvanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is\nrigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical\nsimulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding\nof the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.",
