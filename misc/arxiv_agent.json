      "title": "BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data\n  Generation",
      "summary": "Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress\nof computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\nthe project page.",

      "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with\naccess to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their\neffectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal\ntrajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with\na vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes\nmultimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM\ncontroller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs\nM-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified\ntrajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we\ndevelop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool\nreasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of\n11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via\nstep-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,\nMATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating\nscalable and effective multimodal tool use.

      "title": "Agent Learning via Early Experience",
      "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

      "summary": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural\nlanguage instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants\ndemanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing\napproaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack\neffective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory\nincorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only\nenvironmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that\nencode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse\nmemory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios\ndemonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all\nscenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent\nbaseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory\nreduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental\nand behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis\nindicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this\nimagination-guided paradigm.

      "summary": "Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization\nis the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly\nunder different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.\nTo achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover\ndifferent spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy\nvia imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that\nleverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from\nminimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant\nsim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as\nfixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we\npropose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly\naugments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.\nR2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and\nplug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce\nan annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A\ngroup-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object\ncompositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware\nprocessing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D\nsensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive\nexperiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on\nmobile manipulation.",

      "title": "CoMAS: Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Interaction Rewards",
      "summary": "Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model\n(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.\nRecent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning\n(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of\ninteraction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number\nand diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and\neffective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.",

      "title": "CaRT: Teaching LLM Agents to Know When They Know Enough",
      "summary": "Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant\ninformation over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a\ntask. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.",

However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates\nchallenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often\ndegrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on\nsemantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically\ncoherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with\nsemantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A\nfolding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,\nenables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI\nand nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art\ncompression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both\nstructural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream\napplications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,\nachieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained\nwith raw LiDAR scans.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general\nprogramming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios\nsuch as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends\nheavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply\ngenerating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack\nfine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or\ntree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical\nlinks. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based\ncoding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior\nguidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS\nretains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure\ninto the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical\ntrajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and\ncollaborative learning.

      "summary": "Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on\nhigh-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is\ntask-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational\nresources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable\nlearning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce\nGaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal\nattention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the\nagent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that\nreturn differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations\nproduce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely\ntask-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized\nthrough return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to\ndistinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group\nsimilar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their\nreturn differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive\ntriplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention\nmechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with\ndifferent outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample\nefficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated\nacross a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without\nmodifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.",

      "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,\ndemonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual\nand textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a\npromising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected\ncorner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a\nmodel must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical\nobjects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require\nsystems that are not \"shortsighted\", i.e., systems with strong perception\ncapabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With\nthis in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question\nAnswering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused\nsolely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance\nannotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that\nmodel performance reflects perception capabilities alone.
