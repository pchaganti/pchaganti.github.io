      "title": "Fix Before Search: Benchmarking Agentic Query Visual Pre-processing in Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation",
      "summary": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for grounding MLLMs with external knowledge. While query pre-processing (e.g., rewriting) is standard in text-based RAG, existing MRAG pipelines predominantly treat visual inputs as static and immutable, implicitly assuming they are noise-free. However, real-world visual queries are often ``imperfect'' -- suffering from geometric distortions, quality degradation, or semantic ambiguity -- leading to catastrophic retrieval failures. To address this gap, we propose V-QPP-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to Visual Query Pre-processing (V-QPP). We formulate V-QPP as an agentic decision-making task where MLLMs must autonomously diagnose imperfections and deploy perceptual tools to refine queries. Our extensive evaluation across 46,700 imperfect queries and diverse MRAG paradigms reveals three critical insights: (1) Vulnerability -- visual imperfections severely degrade both retrieval recall and end-to-end MRAG performance; (2) Restoration Potential \\& Bottleneck -- while oracle preprocessing recovers near-perfect performance, off-the-shelf MLLMs struggle with tool selection and parameter prediction without specialized training; and (3) Training Enhancement -- supervised fine-tuning enables compact models to achieve comparable or superior performance to larger proprietary models, demonstrating the benchmark's value for developing robust MRAG systems The code is available at https://github.com/phycholosogy/VQQP_Bench",

      "title": "Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \\textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.",

      "title": "In-Context Autonomous Network Incident Response: An End-to-End Large Language Model Agent Approach",
      "summary": "Rapidly evolving cyberattacks demand incident response systems that can autonomously learn and adapt to changing threats. Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.",

      "title": "Peaceful Anarcho-Accelerationism: Decentralized Full Automation for a Society of Universal Care",
      "summary": "The convergence of large language models that automate cognitive labor and deep reinforcement learning agents that automate physical labor implies the near-complete elimination of human employment. The universal approximation theorem and foundational DRL results establish that all labor is in principle automatable. The critical question is not whether full automation will arrive, but who will control it. This paper introduces peaceful anarcho-accelerationism: a sociotechnical framework ensuring that full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. We propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons built on open-source technologies. We show that this framework builds bridges with liberalism, socialism, environmentalism, feminism, cooperativism, and the hacker ethic. Empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon, Rojava, and guifi.net confirms that commons-based systems already operate at scale. We argue that full automation renders money obsolete and propose Universal Desired Resources (UDR), a post-monetary design principle where every person requests what they need from the robotic commons, constrained only by ecological sustainability. Drawing on the independence of phenomenal consciousness from computational intelligence, we establish that delegating labor to non-conscious machines is care at civilizational scale, and that moral policy can be studied through deep reinforcement learning. We conclude with a phased roadmap toward the care-centered society, including milestones, assumptions, and limitations.",

      "summary": "We present AutoOptimization, a novel multi-objective optimization framework for adapting user interfaces. From a user's verbal preferences for changing a UI, our framework guides a prioritization-based Pareto frontier search over candidate layouts. It selects suitable objective functions for UI placement while simultaneously parameterizing them according to the user's instructions to define the optimization problem. A solver then generates a series of optimal UI layouts, which our framework validates against the user's instructions to adapt the UI with the final solution. Our approach thus overcomes the previous need for manual inspection of layouts and the use of population averages for objective parameters. We integrate multiple agents sequentially within our framework, enabling the system to leverage their reasoning capabilities to interpret user preferences, configure the optimization problem, and validate optimization outcomes.",

      "title": "UniManip: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation with Agentic Operational Graph",
      "summary": "Achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation requires robots to seamlessly bridge high-level semantic intent with low-level physical interaction in unstructured environments. However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

      "title": "Agentic AI for Robot Control: Flexible but still Fragile",
      "summary": "Recent work leverages the capabilities and commonsense priors of generative models for robot control. In this paper, we present an agentic control system in which a reasoning-capable language model plans and executes tasks by selecting and invoking robot skills within an iterative planner and executor loop. We deploy the system on two physical robot platforms in two settings: (i) tabletop grasping, placement, and box insertion in indoor mobile manipulation (Mobipick) and (ii) autonomous agricultural navigation and sensing (Valdemar). Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.",

      "summary": "Question answering (QA) over structured tables requires not only accurate answers but also transparency about which cells support them. Existing table QA systems rarely provide fine-grained attribution, so even correct answers often lack verifiable grounding, limiting trust in high-stakes settings. We address this with TraceBack, a modular multi-agent framework for scalable, cell-level attribution in single-table QA. TraceBack prunes tables to relevant rows and columns, decomposes questions into semantically coherent sub-questions, and aligns each answer span with its supporting cells, capturing both explicit and implicit evidence used in intermediate reasoning steps. To enable systematic evaluation, we release CITEBench, a benchmark with phrase-to-cell annotations drawn from ToTTo, FetaQA, and AITQA. We further propose FairScore, a reference-less metric that compares atomic facts derived from predicted cells and answers to estimate attribution precision and recall without human cell labels. Experiments show that TraceBack substantially outperforms strong baselines across datasets and granularities, while FairScore closely tracks human judgments and preserves relative method rankings, supporting interpretable and scalable evaluation of table-based QA.",

      "summary": "Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) are increasingly regarded as a core intelligence engine for embodied AI applications. However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.",

      "summary": "Cities host most of the world population with diverse services and activities. One key challenge in urban modelling is the quantification of intra- and inter-city mobility patterns and the associated space-time dynamics of population density and anthropogenic activities. To address this, we apply the novel agent-based urban model DAVE (Dynamic Anthropogenic actiVities and feedback to Emissions) to simulate population behaviour and mobility in the Vaud and Geneva Cantons, a system of small- to medium-size cities in Switzerland. Simulation results provide detailed temporal (10 min) and spatial (500 m) population dynamics for different age groups and day types. DAVE further models the time-varying population distribution in 11 different microenvironments (e.g., home, work, leisure, outdoor) and the travel flows by different modes. Simulation results align with observations, confirming the possibility of driving urban system modelling with statistical information on residents' behaviour. Sustainability and health indicators like daily driving distance and walking time for each neighbourhood are also reflected by the model with urban-rural gradients displayed. This work serves as a foundation for future applications of DAVE to study bottom-up human-built environment interactions, from anthropogenic emissions and building energy to urban climate, exposure, and health in cities around the world.",

      "title": "SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents",
      "summary": "Scientific reasoning inherently demands integrating sophisticated toolkits to navigate domain-specific knowledge. Yet, current benchmarks largely overlook agents' ability to orchestrate tools for such rigorous workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym, a scalable interactive environment featuring 1,780 domain-specific tools across four natural science disciplines, supported by a robust execution infrastructure. Complementing this, we present SciAgentBench, a tiered evaluation suite designed to stress-test agentic capabilities from elementary actions to long-horizon workflows. Our evaluation identifies a critical bottleneck: state-of-the-art models struggle with complex scientific tool-use. Even for a leading model like GPT-5, success rates drop sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons extend, primarily due to failures in multi-step workflow execution. To address this, we propose SciForge, a data synthesis method that models the tool action space as a dependency graph to generate logic-aware training trajectories. By fine-tuning on these trajectories, our SciAgent-8B outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct while exhibiting positive cross-domain transfer of scientific tool-use capabilities. These results underscore the promising potential of next-generation autonomous scientific agents.",

Choreographies can be regarded as an extension of Alice-and-Bob notation, providing an intuitive high-level view of the protocol as a whole (rather than specifying each protocol role in isolation). The extensions over standard Alice-and-Bob notation that we consider are non-deterministic choice, conditional branching, and mutable long-term memory. We define the semantics of CryptoChoreo by translation to a process calculus. This semantics entails an understanding of the protocol: it determines how agents parse and check incoming messages and how they construct outgoing messages, in the presence of an arbitrary algebraic theory and non-deterministic choices made by other agents. While this semantics entails algebraic problems that are in general undecidable, we give an implementation for a representative theory. We connect this translation to ProVerif and show on a number of case studies that the approach is practically feasible.",

To address this imbalance, we introduce Human Tool, an MCP-style interface abstraction, building on recent Model Context Protocol designs, that exposes humans as callable tools within AI-led, proactive workflows. Here, \"tool\" denotes a coordination abstraction, not a reduction of human authority or responsibility. Building on LLM-based agent architectures, we operationalize Human Tool by modeling human contributions through structured tool schemas of capabilities, information, and authority. These schemas enable agents to dynamically invoke human input based on relative strengths and reintegrate it through efficient, natural interaction protocols. We validate the framework through controlled studies in both decision-making and creative tasks, demonstrating improved task performance, reduced human workload, and more balanced collaboration dynamics compared to baseline systems. Finally, we discuss implications for human-centered AI design, highlighting how MCP-style human tools enable strong AI leadership while amplifying uniquely human strengths.",

      "title": "Solving Qualitative Multi-Objective Stochastic Games",
      "summary": "Many problems in compositional synthesis and verification of multi-agent systems -- such as rational verification and assume-guarantee verification in probabilistic systems -- reduce to reasoning about two-player multi-objective stochastic games. This motivates us to study the problem of characterizing the complexity and memory requirements for two-player stochastic games with Boolean combinations of qualitative reachability and safety objectives. Reachability objectives require that a given set of states is reached; safety requires that a given set is invariant. A qualitative winning condition asks that an objective is satisfied almost surely (AS) or (in negated form) with non-zero (NZ) probability.\n  We study the determinacy and complexity landscape of the problem. We show that games with conjunctions of AS and NZ reachability and safety objectives are determined, and determining the winner is PSPACE-complete. The same holds for positive boolean combinations of AS reachability and safety, as well as for negations thereof. On the other hand, games with full Boolean combinations of qualitative objectives are not determined, and are NEXPTIME-hard. Our hardness results show a connection between stochastic games and logics with partially-ordered quantification. Our results shed light on the relationship between determinacy and complexity, and extend the complexity landscape for stochastic games in the multi-objective setting.",

      "title": "Never say never: Exploring the effects of available knowledge on agent persuasiveness in controlled physiotherapy motivation dialogues",
      "summary": "Generative Social Agents (GSAs) are increasingly impacting human users through persuasive means. On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.",

      "summary": "We study the problem of contextual online bilateral trade. At each round, the learner faces a seller-buyer pair and must propose a trade price without observing their private valuations for the item being sold. The goal of the learner is to post prices to facilitate trades between the two parties. Before posting a price, the learner observes a $d$-dimensional context vector that influences the agent's valuations. Prior work in the contextual setting has focused on linear models. In this work, we tackle a general nonparametric setting in which the buyer's and seller's valuations behave according to arbitrary Lipschitz functions of the context. We design an algorithm that leverages contextual information through a hierarchical tree construction and guarantees regret $\\widetilde{O}(T^{{(d-1)}/d})$. Remarkably, our algorithm operates under two stringent features of the setting: (1) one-bit feedback, where the learner only observes whether a trade occurred or not, and (2) strong budget balance, where the learner cannot subsidize or profit from the market participants. We further provide a matching lower bound in the full-feedback setting, demonstrating the tightness of our regret bound.",

      "summary": "We study repeated bilateral trade when the valuations of the sellers and the buyers are contextual. More precisely, the agents' valuations are given by the inner product of a context vector with two unknown $d$-dimensional vectors -- one for the buyers and one for the sellers.\n  At each time step $t$, the learner receives a context and posts two prices, one for the seller and one for the buyer, and the trade happens if both agents accept their price. We study two objectives for this problem, gain from trade and profit, proving no-regret with respect to a surprisingly strong benchmark: the best omniscient dynamic strategy.\n  In the natural scenario where the learner observes \\emph{separately} whether the agents accept their price -- the so-called \\emph{two-bit} feedback -- we design algorithms that achieve $O(d\\log d)$ regret for gain from trade, and $O(d \\log\\log T + d\\log d)$ regret for profit maximization. Both results are tight, up to the $\\log(d)$ factor, and implement per-step budget balance, meaning that the learner never incurs negative profit.\n  In the less informative \\emph{one-bit} feedback model, the learner only observes whether a trade happens or not. For this scenario, we show that the tight two-bit regret regimes are still attainable, at the cost of allowing the learner to possibly incur a small negative profit of order $O(d\\log d)$, which is notably independent of the time horizon. As a final set of results, we investigate the combination of one-bit feedback and per-step budget balance. There, we design an algorithm for gain from trade that suffers regret independent of the time horizon, but \\emph{exponential} in the dimension $d$. For profit maximization, we maintain this exponential dependence on the dimension, which gets multiplied by a $\\log T$ factor.",

Trading off performance and sustainability SLOs is especially challenging. This challenge can be addressed with intelligent decision systems, able to reconfigure the services during runtime to meet the SLOs. However, developing these agents while adhering to the MSA pattern is complex, especially because CC providers, who have key know-how and information to fulfill these SLOs, must comply with the privacy requirements of application developers.
