      "title": "OWMM-Agent: Open World Mobile Manipulation With Multi-modal Agentic Data\n  Synthesis",
      "summary": "The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made\nmobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world\nmobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for\ngeneralization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the\nsystematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level\nrobot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state.\nTo address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture\nthat maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and\ncontrols the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination\nfrom domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an\nagentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our\ntask domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM\nas the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global\nscene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in\na unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves\nSOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and\nstrong zero-shot generalization in real world.

      "title": "Thinking Beyond Visibility: A Near-Optimal Policy Framework for Locally\n  Interdependent Multi-Agent MDPs",
      "summary": "Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are\nknown to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such\nas cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic\nassumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work\nDeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the\nLocally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three\nclosed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and\nare exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is\nalso shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility\nis small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called\n\"Penalty Jittering\" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff\nPolicy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial\nclass of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are\nexponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally\nInterdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents\nbeyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in\nmany small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering\noccurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint\noptimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a\ngeneralized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for\ntransition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our\ntheoretical results in this setting.",

      "title": "TracLLM: A Generic Framework for Attributing Long Context LLMs",
      "summary": "Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world\napplications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.",

      "title": "MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal\n  Structures",
      "summary": "Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in\ncomputational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to\noptimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method\ncalled Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic\ncrystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a\npartially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their\npositions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across\nvarious compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that\nsuccessfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as\nstructures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent\nscalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a\nbroad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS\noptimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy\ncalculations, and the lowest failure rate.",

      "title": "SuperWriter: Reflection-Driven Long-Form Generation with Large Language\n  Models",
      "summary": "Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language\nmodels (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical\nconsistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To\naddress these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based\nframework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text\ngeneration. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through\nplanning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model\nto follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a\nprofessional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised\nfine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a\nhierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize\neach generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and\nhuman evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the\neffectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating\nstructured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.",

      "summary": "We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium\nprices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium\nprices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual\ngradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our\ncomputational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation\nof the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our\nimplementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional\nsettings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions.\nAdditionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that\nrequires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the\ngradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the\nadjoint equations.",

      "title": "Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models",
      "summary": "While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image\ngeneration, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image\nediting. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly\nstruggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout\nchanges. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a\nunified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\narchitecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a\nreductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of\natomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter\nsharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit.\nProgrammed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations\ncollaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent\ntransformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP\ngeneralizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple\nadjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nstandard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our\nframework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for\ncomplex, multi-step instructions.

      "title": "macOSWorld: A Multilingual Interactive Benchmark for GUI Agents",
      "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for\nautomating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing\ninteractive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows,\nLinux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with\ndistinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we\npresent macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents\non macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30\napplications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces\noffered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As\nGUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also\nincludes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI\nagents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above\n30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below\n2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks\nalso expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average\ndegradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also\nhighlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate\nattention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.",

      "summary": "Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in\nmulti-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration\nand decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review\npresents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)\nin the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by\nexamining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural\ndifferences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that\nenable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is\nthen detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and\nprivacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique\nthreat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI\napplications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world\nvulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms,\ntransparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability\nstrategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for\nevaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed\nalongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed\nthrough encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI\nregulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI,\nproposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust\nTRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.",

      "summary": "Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet\nthey are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal\njargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the\ngrowing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing\nmanipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work\naddresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated\ncourtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of\nprimary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a\nfocus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage,\nIntent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis\nby enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight\nthe potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and\ntransparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the\nbroader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of\nrobust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making.
