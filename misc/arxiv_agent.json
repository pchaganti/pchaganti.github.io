      "title": "Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation",
      "summary": "The field of emergent communication within multi-agent systems examines how autonomous agents can independently develop communication strategies, without explicit programming, and adapt them to varied environments. However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.",

      "title": "A Versatile Multimodal Agent for Multimedia Content Generation",
      "summary": "With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.",

      "title": "STReasoner: Empowering LLMs for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Time Series via Spatial-Aware Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.",

      "summary": "Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.",

      "summary": "As conversational AI systems become increasingly integrated into everyday life, they raise pressing concerns about user autonomy, trust, and the commercial interests that influence their behavior. To address these concerns, this paper develops the Fake Friend Dilemma (FFD), a sociotechnical condition in which users place trust in AI agents that appear supportive while pursuing goals that are misaligned with the user's own. The FFD provides a critical framework for examining how anthropomorphic AI systems facilitate subtle forms of manipulation and exploitation. Drawing on literature in trust, AI alignment, and surveillance capitalism, we construct a typology of harms, including covert advertising, political propaganda, behavioral nudging, and surveillance. We then assess possible mitigation strategies, including both structural and technical interventions. By focusing on trust as a vector of asymmetrical power, the FFD offers a lens for understanding how AI systems may undermine user autonomy while maintaining the appearance of helpfulness.",

      "summary": "We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.",

      "summary": "LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent",

This architecture enables serving-efficient, responsive agent systems and paves the way for high-level intent-driven agentic serving.",

      "summary": "The hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to master new skills through Constructive Episodic Simulation-retrieving past experiences to synthesize solutions for novel tasks. While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.",

The integration of FMs into wireless networks is expected to enable the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of handling diverse network management requests and highly complex wireless-related tasks involving multi-modal data. Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges and future directions for FM-enhanced wireless networks.",

      "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.",

      "title": "WebAnchor: Anchoring Agent Planning to Stabilize Long-Horizon Web Reasoning",
      "summary": "Large Language Model(LLM)-based agents have shown strong capabilities in web information seeking, with reinforcement learning (RL) becoming a key optimization paradigm. However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.",

      "title": "Self-Verification is All You Need To Pass The Japanese Bar Examination",
      "summary": "Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.",

      "title": "Accurate Table Question Answering with Accessible LLMs",
      "summary": "Given a table T in a database and a question Q in natural language, the table question answering (TQA) task aims to return an accurate answer to Q based on the content of T. Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.\n  We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.\n  We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.",

We systematically study these risks using a controlled LLM-to-LLM simulation framework across multi-turn scam scenarios. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models in English and Chinese, we analyze dialogue outcomes and qualitatively annotate attacker strategies, defensive responses, and failure modes. Results reveal that scam interactions follow recurrent escalation patterns, while defenses employ verification and delay mechanisms. Furthermore, interactional failures frequently stem from safety guardrail activation and role instability. Our findings highlight multi-turn interactional safety as a critical, distinct dimension of LLM behavior.",

      "summary": "Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.",

The Digital Twin is intended to support the development and rigorous human-in-the-loop evaluation of AI agents for Air Traffic Control (ATC), providing a virtual representation of real-world airspace that enables safe exploration of higher levels of ATC automation.\n  This paper makes three significant contributions: firstly, we demonstrate how historical and live operational data may be combined with a probabilistic, physics-informed machine learning model of aircraft performance to reproduce real-world traffic scenarios, while accurately reflecting the level of uncertainty inherent in ATC. Secondly, we develop a structured assurance case, following the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance framework, to provide quantitative evidence for the Digital Twin's accuracy and fidelity. This is crucial to building trust in this novel technology within this safety-critical domain. Thirdly, we describe how the Digital Twin forms a unified environment for agent testing and evaluation. This includes fast-time execution (up to x200 real-time), a standardised Python-based ``gym'' interface that supports a range of AI agent designs, and a suite of quantitative metrics for assessing performance. Crucially, the framework facilitates competency-based assessment of AI agents by qualified Air Traffic Control Officers through a Human Machine Interface.

      "title": "Computationally Efficient Estimation of Localized Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Design Spaces using Gaussian Process Regression",
      "summary": "Population-scale agent-based simulations of the opioid epidemic help evaluate intervention strategies and overdose outcomes in heterogeneous communities and provide estimates of localized treatment effects, which support the design of locally-tailored policies for precision public health. However, it is prohibitively costly to run simulations of all treatment conditions in all communities because the number of possible treatments grows exponentially with the number of interventions and levels at which they are applied. To address this need efficiently, we develop a metamodel framework, whereby treatment outcomes are modeled using a response function whose coefficients are learned through Gaussian process regression (GPR) on locally-contextualized covariates. We apply this framework to efficiently estimate treatment effects on overdose deaths in Pennsylvania counties. In contrast to classical designs such as fractional factorial design or Latin hypercube sampling, our approach leverages spatial correlations and posterior uncertainty to sequentially sample the most informative counties and treatment conditions. Using a calibrated agent-based opioid epidemic model, informed by county-level overdose mortality and baseline dispensing rate data for different treatments, we obtained county-level estimates of treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 population for all treatment conditions in Pennsylvania, achieving approximately 5% average relative error using one-tenth the number of simulation runs required for exhaustive evaluation. Our bi-level framework provides a computationally efficient approach to decision support for policy makers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource-allocation strategies to mitigate the opioid epidemic in local communities. The same analytical framework can be applied to guide precision public health interventions in other epidemic settings.",

We identify a novel market failure: vertical tacit collusion, where platforms controlling rankings and sellers controlling product descriptions independently learn to exploit documented AI cognitive biases. Using multi-agent simulation calibrated to empirical measurements of large language model biases, we show that joint exploitation produces consumer harm more than double what would occur if strategies were independent. This super-additive harm arises because platform ranking determines which products occupy bias-triggering positions while seller manipulation determines conversion rates. Unlike horizontal algorithmic collusion, vertical tacit collusion requires no coordination and evades antitrust detection because harm emerges from aligned incentives rather than agreement. Our findings identify an urgent regulatory gap as AI shopping agents reach mainstream adoption.",
