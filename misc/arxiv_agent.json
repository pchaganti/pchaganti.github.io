      "title": "ALE-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Objective-Driven Algorithm\n  Engineering",
      "summary": "How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization\nproblems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory\nproduction planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new\nbenchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming\ncontests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench\npresents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known\nexact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench\nencourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software\nframework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run\nfeedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that\nwhile they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap\nremains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and\nlong-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this\nbenchmark to foster future AI advancements.",

      "summary": "Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core\nchallenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven\nreasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have\nleveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have\nbegun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,\nthese VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse\nembodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical\nbenchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three\nstructured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.\nVIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,\nand structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual\ninputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a\ntwo-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)\nusing Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement\nlearning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that\nVIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.\nFurthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of\ncompositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,\nVIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing\nmulti-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.",

      "title": "Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual\n  Backpropagation",
      "summary": "Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for\naddressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely\non static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these\nconstraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that\nconceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network\narchitecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer\nforms a cooperative \"team\" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural\nNetwork follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing\ninspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically\ndecomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation\nmethods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring\nbackpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through\niterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and\ncoordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or\nspecialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and\nadaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent\nbaselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance\nimprovements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven\nframework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of\nLLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan\nto open-source the entire framework.",

Literature has had a\ntheoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either\nto the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss\nlandscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.\nTherefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method\ninspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach\nvisualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model\nparameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of\nthe interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk\nlandscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic\nclassification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk\nvisualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction\n- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different\nfrom the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack\nfull access to the deployed model.",

      "summary": "Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been\ndeveloped to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates\nwith an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a\nrange of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that\nUI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents\ngenerally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting\nrepresentative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and\nattention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.\nInspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient\nscheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nextrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing\nlong-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nachieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on\ncompositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without\nsignificantly sacrificing inference overhead.

To\nimprove the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental\nstate perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a\ncalibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted\nAdversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised\nlearning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains\nthe agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results\nsubstantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state\nperturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results\ndemonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may\nnot be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of\nagents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.",

However, existing benchmarks\nface significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity,\nextensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of\nmultidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce\nOmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an\nautomated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through\nsubtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on\nthe graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework\nthat includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive\ntests across 10 capabilities.

      "title": "Enhancing generalizability of model discovery across parameter space\n  with multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL)",
      "summary": "Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding\nself-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and\noften not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive\ncontinuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive\nsimulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In\nthis work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by\nintroducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns\nindividual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,\nand embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library\nacross parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field\nmodel and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with\nspatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the\nrelative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT\nME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings\nhighlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to\nenhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex\nbiological systems.",

      "title": "Intention-Conditioned Flow Occupancy Models",
      "summary": "Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning\nresearch is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can\nbe used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute\nresources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific\ntasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing\nbecause it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,\nincluding sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a\nfundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions\nhave long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across\ntime is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for\nmodeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic\nmodel to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant\nfuture (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are\noften constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include\nin our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention\nincreases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with\ngeneralized policy improvement. We call our proposed method\nintention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative\nmethods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$\nimage-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8\n\\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\\%$.\nWebsite: https://chongyi-zheng.github.io/infom Code:\nhttps://github.com/chongyi-zheng/infom",

Classical robot crowd navigation\nmethods decouple human motion prediction from robot motion planning, which\nneglects the closed-loop interactions between humans and robots. This lack of a\nmodel for human reactions to the robot plan (e.g. moving out of the way) can\ncause the robot to get stuck. Our proposed Safe and Interactive Crowd\nNavigation (SICNav) method is a bilevel Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nframework that combines prediction and planning into one optimization problem,\nexplicitly modeling interactions among agents. In this paper, we present a\nsystems overview of the crowd navigation platform we use to deploy SICNav in\npreviously unseen indoor and outdoor environments.

      "title": "Agile Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Task Scheduling in Edge\n  Computing",
      "summary": "Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing\nsignificant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing\nenvironments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential\ngrowth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and\nhighly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the\ncomplexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and\nmetaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating\noptimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to\nadapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of\nedge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been\nincorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions\ninherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant\nlimitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time\nrequired to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale\nproblems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and\nfrequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study\nproposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs\ninformed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the\npredictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and\nconvergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the\ntasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments\ndemonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking\nmethods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the\nbaseline approaches.",
