      "title": "Virtual Community: An Open World for Humans, Robots, and Society",
      "summary": "The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal\ntransformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared\ncommunities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this\nfuture, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,\nand society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D\nscenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments.",

      "summary": "Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown\nimpressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research\nsystems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking\nand synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown\nimpressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain\nchallenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited\naccuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model\nlacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the\nframework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored\nfor medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses\nthese challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data\nsynthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest\nchains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex\nmulti-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private\nmedical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate\nmedical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse\ntrajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool\ninteractions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised\nfine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our\nMedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing\nnew state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining\ncompetitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates\nthat strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and\ntraining data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform\nmuch larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.",

At a critical\nparameter value, we find destabilization of a trivial branch of uniformly\ndistributed solutions and analyze bifurcating solutions. Curiously, the\nbifurcating branch is vertical, leading to a reversible, non-hysteretic phase\ntransition.

We also study the\neffect of small noise and the eventual topological transition from vacuum\nbubbles to isolated particle clusters.",

      "title": "From Passive Tool to Socio-cognitive Teammate: A Conceptual Framework\n  for Agentic AI in Human-AI Collaborative Learning",
      "summary": "The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid\ntransformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool\ntowards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This\nshift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of\nproactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual\nframework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI\ninteraction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant\nimplications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda\nfor AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning\nenvironments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.",

      "title": "HERAKLES: Hierarchical Skill Compilation for Open-ended LLM Agents",
      "summary": "Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing\ncomplexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling\nefficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to\nkeep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated\ngrowth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent\napproaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and\nlanguage, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization\ncapabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing\napproaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a\nhierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such\ndesigns are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally\ndiversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a\nframework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously\ncompile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast\nneural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the\nhigh-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the\nhigh-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and\ngeneralization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We\nevaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales\neffectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill\ncompilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over\ntime.",

      "summary": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for\nconnecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly\ngaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

      "title": "Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks: A\n  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach",
      "summary": "Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\nto extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper\npresents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head\nselection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning\nwithin a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on\nthe energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an\nautonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy,\ndistance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions\nthat maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths,\neach sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes\nto a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of\nCharge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient\nlearning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load\ndistribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining\nsignal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or\nvia a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale\ndeployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical\ngraph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum\nSpanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing.\nSimulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node\nsurvival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it\na scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor\ndeployments and IoT applications.",

      "title": "Adaptive Vision-Based Coverage Optimization in Mobile Wireless Sensor\n  Networks: A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach",
      "summary": "Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of\nthe target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial\ndeployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued\nnetwork operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile\nWireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static\ncoverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This\npaper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously\nposition themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for\npredefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and\nevaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor\nmovement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network\nthrough a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling\ndecentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a\nvision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL\nframework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that\nadjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to\ntraditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5%\nimprovement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22%\ndecrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach\nsignificantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in\nMWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.",

      "summary": "In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events\nhas posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We\nevaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three\nrepresentative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily\nlight rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and\nreinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and\nsystem robustness.

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have\nopened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of\nautonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are\ninsufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit\nbelief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially\ngrounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.",

      "summary": "The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become\nincreasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road\ndeployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness.
