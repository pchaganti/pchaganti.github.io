      "title": "Trusted AI Agents in the Cloud",
      "summary": "AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly deployed as cloud services that autonomously access sensitive data, invoke external tools, and interact with other agents. However, these agents run within a complex multi-party ecosystem, where untrusted components can lead to data leakage, tampering, or unintended behavior. Existing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide only per binary protection and offer no guarantees for cross-principal trust, accelerator-level isolation, or supervised agent behavior. We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100, Omega fully secures agent state across CVM-GPU, and achieves high performance while enabling high-density, policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.",

      "title": "A poset representation for stable contracts in a two-sided market generated by integer choice functions",
      "summary": "Generalizing a variety of earlier problems on stable contracts in two-sided markets, Alkan and Gale introduced in 2003 a general stability model on a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the vertices are interpreted as ``agents'', and the edges as possible ``contract'' between pairs of ``agents''. The edges are endowed with nonnegative capacities $b$ giving upper bounds on ``contract intensities'', and the preferencies of each ``agent'' $v\\in V$ depend on a \\emph{choice function} (CFs) that acts on the set of ``contracts'' involving $v$, obeying three well motivated axioms of \\it{consistence}, \\it{substitutability} and \\it{cardinal monotonicity}. In their model, the capacities and choice functions can take reals or discrete values and, extending well-known earlier results on particular cases, they proved that systems of \\it{stable} contracts always exist and, moreover, their set $\\cal S$ constitutes a distributive lattice under a natural comparison relation $\\prec$.\n  In this paper, we study Alkan--Gale's model when all capacities and choice functions take integer values. We characterize the set of rotations -- augmenting cycles linking neighboring stable assignments in the lattice $(\\cal S,\\prec)$, and construct a weighted poset in which the lattice the closed functions is isomorphic to $(\\cal S,\\prec)$, thus obtaining an explicit representation for the latter. We show that in general the size of the poset is at most $b^{\\rm max}|E|$, where $b^{\\rm max}$ is the maximal capacity, and the poset can be constructed in pseudo polynomial time. Then we explain that by imposing an additional condition on CFs, the size of the poset becomes polynomial in $|V|$, and the total time reduces to a polynomial in $|V|,\\log b^{\\rm max}$.",

      "title": "Zoom in, Click out: Unlocking and Evaluating the Potential of Zooming for GUI Grounding",
      "summary": "Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.",

      "title": "PRiSM: An Agentic Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Reasoning via Python-Grounded Evaluation",
      "summary": "Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific domains like mathematics and physics poses unique challenges that go far beyond predicting final answers. These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.",

      "title": "Natural Language Summarization Enables Multi-Repository Bug Localization by LLMs in Microservice Architectures",
      "summary": "Bug localization in multi-repository microservice architectures is challenging due to the semantic gap between natural language bug reports and code, LLM context limitations, and the need to first identify the correct repository. We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.",

      "title": "Fluctuating Environments Favor Extreme Dormancy Strategies and Penalize Intermediate Ones",
      "summary": "Dormancy is a widespread adaptive strategy that enables populations to persist in fluctuating environments, yet how its benefits depend on the temporal structure of environmental variability remains unclear. We examine how dormancy interacts with environmental correlation times using a delayed-logistic model in which dormant individuals reactivate after a fixed lag while birth rates fluctuate under temporally correlated stochasticity. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations show that the combination of demographic memory and colored multiplicative noise generates a strongly non-monotonic dependence of fitness on dormancy duration, with three distinct performance regimes. Very short dormancy maximizes linear growth but amplifies fluctuations and extinction risk. Very long dormancy buffers environmental variability, greatly increasing mean extinction times despite slower growth. Strikingly, we find a broad band of intermediate dormancy durations that is maladaptive, simultaneously reducing both growth and persistence due to a mismatch between delay times and environmental autocorrelation. An evolutionary agent-based model confirms bistability between short- and long-dormancy strategies, which avoid intermediate lag times and evolve toward stable extremes. These results show that dormancy duration is not merely a life-history parameter but an adaptive mechanism tuned to environmental timescales, and that intermediate \"dangerous middle\" strategies can be inherently disfavored. More broadly, this work identifies a generic mechanism by which demographic delays interacting with correlated environmental variability produce a non-monotonic fitness landscape that selects for extreme timing strategies.",

      "title": "Invariant Price of Anarchy: a Metric for Welfarist Traffic Control",
      "summary": "The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a standard metric for quantifying inefficiency in socio-technical systems, widely used to guide policies like traffic tolling. Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.",

This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.",

      "summary": "This article presents a novel coordination and task-planning framework to enable the simultaneous conflict-free collaboration of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial 3D printing. The proposed framework formulates an optimization problem that takes a construction mission divided into sub-tasks and a team of autonomous UAVs, along with limited volume and battery. It generates an optimal mission plan comprising task assignments and scheduling while accounting for task dependencies arising from the geometric and structural requirements of the 3D design, inter-UAV safety constraints, material usage, and total flight time of each UAV. The potential conflicts occurring during the simultaneous operation of the UAVs are addressed at a segment level by dynamically selecting the starting time and location of each task to guarantee collision-free parallel execution. An importance prioritization is proposed to accelerate the computation by guiding the solution toward more important tasks. Additionally, a utility maximization formulation is proposed to dynamically determine the optimal number of UAVs required for a given mission, balancing the trade-off between minimizing makespan and the deployment of excess agents. The proposed framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a Gazebo-based simulation setup, where agents are coordinated by a mission control module allocating the printing tasks based on the generated optimal scheduling plan while remaining within the material and battery constraints of each UAV.",

      "summary": "Scalable multi-agent driving simulation requires behavior models that are both realistic and computationally efficient. We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.",

      "title": "Task-Specific Trust Evaluation for Multi-Hop Collaborator Selection via GNN-Aided Distributed Agentic AI",
      "summary": "The success of collaborative task completion among networked devices hinges on the effective selection of trustworthy collaborators. However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion.",

      "title": "Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding",
      "summary": "Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.",

We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.",

      "summary": "Erasing memory is a fundamental operational task in quantum information processing, governed by Landauer's principle, which links information loss to thermodynamic work. We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work.",

Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training. While the output is clearly style-aligned, narrative completeness remains a challenge, indicating future work is needed to better model global coherence and story resolution.",

We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC).

While dynamic games provide a natural modeling framework, computing Nash equilibria (NEs) in large-scale settings remains challenging, and existing mean-field game approximations rely on restrictive assumptions that fail to capture collision avoidance and heterogeneous behaviors. This paper proposes an $α$-potential game framework for decentralized CAV control. We show that computing $α$-NE reduces to solving a decentralized control problem, and derive tight bounds of the parameter $α$ based on interaction intensity and asymmetry. We further develop scalable policy gradient algorithms for computing $α$-NEs using decentralized neural-network policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework accommodates diverse traffic flow models and effectively captures collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and agent heterogeneity.",

To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students.

We employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy, which enable direct detection of Gd$^{3+}$ release and evaluation of its molecular surroundings in intact cerebellar tissue from inflamed and non-inflamed brain sections exposed to either linear or macrocyclic GBCAs. The experiments were performed on sub-mm brain samples taken after administration of linear gadopentetate and macrocyclic gadobutrol in vivo in a murine multiple sclerosis model and ex vivo in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures under inflammatory conditions. EPR detected μM range Gd levels in intact cerebellar biopsies and slices and distinguished between complex-bound and released Gd following linear GBCA administration in vivo. In biopsies, we detected by ENDOR phosphorus-containing molecules in the microenvironment of released Gd. Complementary mass spectrometry (MS) and MRI calibration experiments on Gd-spiked homogenized mouse brain tissue were used to assess the relaxation-active fraction of retained Gd evidencing binding to inorganic ligands. Our findings demonstrate inflammation-promoted Gd retention, underscore the importance of integrating in vivo and ex vivo analyses to unravel mechanisms of long-term Gd retention, and suggest that conventional MRI may underestimate the true extent of Gd accumulation, especially under neuroinflammatory conditions.",
