      "title": "A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super\n  Intelligence",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain\nfundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,\nevolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.",

      "summary": "Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet\nextracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the\ncomplexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive\ndomain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either\ninflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous\nagents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.\nGenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists\nthat integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability\nof autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through\ntyped message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a\nshared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning\nframework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action\nUnits and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,\nthereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the\nidiosyncrasies of genomic data.\n  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation\nof 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene\nidentification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%\nrespectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible\ngene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting\nfor latent confounders.

      "summary": "Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world\nNLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse\nhuman perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational\nand medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results\nthat better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional\nautomated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.",

      "summary": "Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based\nagents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or\nmisinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies\nhave exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a\nprincipled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions\nin Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and\nevaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by\nintroducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions\nthat are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)\nenvironment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by\nperforming a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize\ntest cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in\ndeterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we\nadopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware\nprompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without\nenumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on\nfailure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in\nmitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.",

      "summary": "Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like\nauctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper\npresents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs\naffect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we\nassess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to\naccurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework.\nWe compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in\npractice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that\nutility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing\ncognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders\nsystematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for\ncertain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms\nthat assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can\nproduce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which\nmay lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents'\nbehavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy,\nhighlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference\nassumptions in practice.",

      "title": "Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents",
      "summary": "We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with\nprovable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our\nframework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*\nutility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,\nlow-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility\nPreservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict\nweight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,\nwhich merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience\nand impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended\nsettings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether\nan arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by\nreduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable\nisland'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and\nverified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.\nConsequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage\nand generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality\nrather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation\nguidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.",

Here, we\ntake a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein\nagents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the\nerror between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and\nuncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents.

This models\npractical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams.\nRecently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were\nintroduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one\ncan define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent\n$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip\nbetween their bundles that improves the value of $i$.\n  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is\ntwofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a\nstark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.\nFirst, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they\nfail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we\ncan achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a\ncommon ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination\ntechnique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation\nguarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions\nare bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare\nguarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown\nimpressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road\nusers. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework\neffectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method.",

      "summary": "Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural\nenvironments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance\ndetection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the\nagent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its\nobjectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach\nin a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects\ninvolved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle\ninitially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it\nlearns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able\nto plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation.

We evaluate\nLLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations\nfrom human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited\nincentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more\nconsistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised\nfine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic\nreasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two\nstylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on\nindividual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of\nKantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).\nWe find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior\ntoward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned\nagents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous\nvehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples\nillustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from\nstructured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes.

      "summary": "We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32\nbillion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the\nMuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to\naddress training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of\nMuon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero\nloss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training\nprocess, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a\njoint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its\ncapabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking\nmodels, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on\nTau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on\nSWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in\nnon-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding,\nmathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6,\n49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without\nextended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable\nopen-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering\nand agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to\nfacilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.",
