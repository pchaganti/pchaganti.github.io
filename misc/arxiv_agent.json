      "title": "SEAgent: Self-Evolving Computer Use Agent with Autonomous Learning from\n  Experience",
      "summary": "Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents\n(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled\ndata. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a\nsignificant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a\ncompetitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.",

      "title": "From MAS to MARS: Coordination Failures and Reasoning Trade-offs in\n  Hierarchical Multi-Agent Robotic Systems within a Healthcare Scenario",
      "summary": "Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by\nintegrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of\naction execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of\nadvanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains\nlimited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this\ngap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of\nhierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot\nhealthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the\nsystem's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination\nfailures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure\nreports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,\nusing AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure\nand further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models\noperating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical\nfindings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the\nimportance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for\nfuture real-world deployment.

      "summary": "End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in\nimproving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains\nchallenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,\nwe introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for\nmulti-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:\na multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction\nlearning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict\nsuppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the\nneed for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,\nsubstantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate\nTurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and\ndemonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art\nmulti-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that\npretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and\nsignificantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced\nmulti-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.",

However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction\ncategory and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person\nacquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and\negocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the\nmanual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the\nassistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and\ncommands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors\nengage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.\nUnder this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale\nhuman-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of\nmultimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate\nhuman/object motions and verbal commands.

Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,\nwhich require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.\nTo address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,\nmulti-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),\nto solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL\ntechniques.

      "title": "TURA: Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search",
      "summary": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines\ninto conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant\nindustrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system.",

      "summary": "Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent\ninteraction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for\nusers. However, it is well-known that \"listening\" and \"eye contact\" play\ncrucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal\ncommunication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and\nspeech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness.\nMoreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual\nSynthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging\nmultimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual\nresponses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a\nunified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal\nrendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model\nto comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context,\nincluding speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that,\nit employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's\nemotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face\nanimations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains\nconsistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key\noptimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and\nreconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual\nhard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during\nthe generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments\ndemonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides\nusers with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.",

      "summary": "While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing\nframeworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded\nknowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper\ninvestigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary\nideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating\nresearch proposals and systematically compare configurations including group\nsize, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in\ninterdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a\ncomprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across\ndimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our\nresults show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary\nbaselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into\nmore integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive\ndiversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable\nprerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass\neven a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for\ndesigning collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team\nstructure influences creative outcomes.",

      "summary": "We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in\nhigh-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as\npost-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these\nmissions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of\nfailure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a\nbehavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot\nteams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes\nShannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.\nBuilding on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning\n(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a\ntunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:\nBAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for\nsafe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the\ninformativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness\nthrough both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that\nthe BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:\nBAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot\nsurvivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent\ndeployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base\nrelocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value\nof behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in\ncomplex, failure-prone environments.",

This will further\nescalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components\nmust be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be\nobserved in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT).\nHere, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which\nrelies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always\nverifying their privileges whenever a request is made.

Additionally, we\ndefine a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted\nand observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's\ninternal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,\nbut as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into\nnatural language explanations and counterfactuals.

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful\nreasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence\non static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual\naccuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,\noffer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable\nmemory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat\nreasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,\nwe propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And\nIncremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement\nwith large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,\nupdate, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a\nconfidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new\nfacts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with\nvarious LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms\nexisting KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%.

Here, we experimentally\ninvestigate how the softness of microchannel walls affects the swimming\ncharacteristics of self-propelling microswimmers, using autophoretic active\ndroplets as a model system. Remarkably, in a soft microchannel, a\nself-propelling droplet exhibits a run-and-tumble-like motility characterized\nby abrupt reorientations in the swimming direction, which are accompanied by\nlocal reduction and subsequent increase in the swimming speed. Such emergent\nswimming dynamics in response to increasing softness of microchannels have been\npreviously unobserved for synthetic microswimmers.
