      "title": "MineAnyBuild: Benchmarking Spatial Planning for Open-world AI Agents",
      "summary": "Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,\nwhich requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in\nspace perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt\nto various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic\nassembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct\nbenchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial\nreasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers\nfrom the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task\nexecution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive\nbenchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability\nof open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild\nrequires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on\nthe given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial\nplanning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data\ncollection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates\nspatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial\nunderstanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on\nMineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based\nagents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their\nspatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues\nfor the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development\nfor open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.",

      "title": "Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs",
      "summary": "Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by\nvision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate\nstructured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains\ntheir utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive\nsimulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that\nenables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by\ninjecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal\ninput, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that\nprovides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud\ncapturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich\nspatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.\nTogether, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware\nworking memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities\nwith structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on\nthis foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which\nthe VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline\nfeatures high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment\nsetup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene\nhypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and\nchallenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior\nwork. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs\nto perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path\nplanning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in\ncomputer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.",

      "title": "Iterative Self-Incentivization Empowers Large Language Models as Agentic\n  Searchers",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information\nretrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs\nto seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the\ncomplexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To\naddress these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,\nwhere the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds\nthrough a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to\nretrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts\nfine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM\nwith this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and\nassigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a\nre-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM\niteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself\nfor search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,\nestablishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms\nbaselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these\npromising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our\nmethod to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.",

A wide range of\nframeworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.\nThese frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language\nprompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various\nagents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for\nany given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and\nobservability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal\ndiscovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing\ndeveloper observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the\nemergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with\nLLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and\nunintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is\nessential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications\nand for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and\nexplicit definitions.",

Strategic\nreasoning is $\\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about\nother participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making\nstrategic decisions, and learning about others over time.

We propose\nTrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to\nembed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic\nsteganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We\nintroduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to\nevaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a\npractical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs\nvia fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably\ntransmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over\n97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they\nmaintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence.

      "summary": "We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in\ncomplex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on\neither end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG\norchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step\nDefiner, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline\nwith task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries,\nsparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate\ninformation scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these\nchallenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query\ndisambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them\nto dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents\ncommunicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and\nsynthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow\nwithout any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand,\nenabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation.\nThis modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver\nrobust, interpretable results.

      "summary": "Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by\ndesign, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,\nthis trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo\nensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer\nefficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We\npresent SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts\natomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.\nEach diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that\nselects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic\nconstraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition\nrates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise\ndecision making. Training follows a centralized-training,\ndecentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across\nsystem sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a\nbenchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers\nis the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on\na single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.\nIt delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower\nmemory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,\nSwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies\nphysical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven\nintelligence.",

      "summary": "Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve\ngoals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on\nsophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.\nAlthough training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher\nmodels has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still\nfaces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To\nmitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving\nLLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that\ninclude reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the\neffectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to\nbecome agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce\npartial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or\nsuboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent\nperformance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld.\nFor the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected\ntrajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it\nachieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents\ntrained exclusively on expert trajectories.",

They also offer players the opportunity\nto engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or\ncooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and\neven more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of\nidentifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads\nto two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement\nhuman-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.\n  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most\nsignificant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual\nenvironment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically\nfocuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are\ndiscussed in detail.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based\nagents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in\nstudent simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at\nvarious cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful\nassistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they\nstruggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often\nproduce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that\ncharacterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student\nsimulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student\nusing a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from\npast learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict\nstudent performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these\npredictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better\nreplicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the\n\\texttt{Student\\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python\nprogramming and $5,000$ learning records.

      "summary": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images\ngiven a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying\ntext-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often\ngenerate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as\nan intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image.\nModels are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated\ntext, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using\ncontrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces\nerror propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings\naccumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning\nAgent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries\nby directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target\nimage>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic\ntriplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional\nqueries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard\nCIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Unlike existing\nmethods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM\nusing real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks.\nWe address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to\ninternalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive\nexperience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings.
