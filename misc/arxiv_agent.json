      "title": "DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for\n  Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration",
      "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.",

      "title": "Environment Agnostic Goal-Conditioning, A Study of Reward-Free\n  Autonomous Learning",
      "summary": "In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning\nenvironments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve\ntasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve\ntasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training\ntimes comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is\nindependent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method\nis environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,\nleading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our\nexperiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and\nstabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any\nobservations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior\nto specific use cases.",

      "title": "Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest\n  Path Problems",
      "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics\nand traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to\nachieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a\nnatural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While\nthe problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent\nsettings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In\nthis work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying\nnovel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.\nOur main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on\nthe construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our\nregret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the\ninherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning\ncomplexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of\nefficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.",

      "title": "Complexity as Advantage: A Regret-Based Perspective on Emergent\n  Structure",
      "summary": "We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the\ncomplexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring\ncomplexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a\nsystem induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is\ncomplex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an\ninformation advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of\nemergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and\nobserver-dependent structure. The framework suggests that \"interesting\" systems\nare those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,\nproviding a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally\nvaluable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss\nimplications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.",

      "title": "Jr. AI Scientist and Its Risk Report: Autonomous Scientific Exploration\n  from a Baseline Paper",
      "summary": "Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is\nessential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific\nprogress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify\nimportant limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science\nreviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI\nScientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we\ncomprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope\nthese insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI\nScientist development.",
