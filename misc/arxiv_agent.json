      "summary": "Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use\npeer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal\ninformation sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance\nresource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a\nrandomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted\nsearch (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective\nforaging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation,\nand targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\\rho$, that\nbalances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how\n$\\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness\n($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\\sigma$),\nrevealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\\rho \\to 0$, agents\nexplore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\\rho$ increases,\nindividuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\\eta$ first\nrises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency\nis optimized at interior $\\rho$ values that balance exploration and\nexploitation. At the largest $\\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but\nefficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing\nnegative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.",
