      "title": "VLN-R1: Vision-Language Navigation via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning",
      "summary": "Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,\nrequiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language\ninstructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on\ndiscrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node\nconnections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams\ninto continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by\nDeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego\ndataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling\nto balance historical and current observations. While large language models can\nsupervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level\ncontrol. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with\nexpert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced\nwith a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights\nmulti-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong\nperformance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied\nnavigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,\nreward-driven post-training.",

      "summary": "An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point\ntrip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and\nbenchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a\nscene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the\nscene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified\nnext-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion\nsimulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between\nclosed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable\nlong-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in\nshort-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other\nmethods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be\nreleased at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen",

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair\nsystems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source\nPython repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench\nVerified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing\nsolutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed\ndocumentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain\nunclear.

The paradigm employs a modular architecture of\nfour LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically\nadapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to\ncomplex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically\nthrough coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems\ninto executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content\nsynthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this\nparadigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,\naligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,\nspanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations.

We demonstrate that standard frameworks, such as type\nstructures, fail to capture misalignment, necessitating new tools to analyze\nthis phenomenon. To this end, we characterize misalignment through\nnon-belief-closed state spaces and introduce agent-dependent type structures,\nwhich provide a flexible tool to understand the varying degrees of\nmisalignment. Furthermore, we establish that appropriately adapted modal\noperators on agent-dependent type structures behave consistently with standard\nproperties, enabling us to explore the implications of misalignment for\ninteractive reasoning. Finally, we show how speculative trade can arise under\nmisalignment, even when imposing the corresponding assumptions that rule out\nsuch trades in standard environments.",

In particular,\nour method of translation preserves many classical properties of relational\nstructures, such as transitivity and the Euclidean property.

      "title": "When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?",
      "summary": "Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.",

      "summary": "Releasing capsules are widely employed in biomedical applications as smart\ncarriers of therapeutic agents, including drugs and bioactive compounds. Such\ndelivery vehicles typically consist of a loaded core, enclosed by one or\nmultiple concentric coating strata. In this work, we extend over existing\nmechanistic models to account for such multi-strata structures, and we\ncharacterise the release kinetics of the active substance into the surrounding\nmedium.\n  We present a computational study of drug release from a multi-stratum\nspherical microcapsule, modelled through a non-linear diffusion equation\nincorporating radial anisotropy and space- and time-discontinuous coefficients.\nThe problem is solved numerically using a finite volume scheme on a grid with\nadaptive spatial and temporal resolution. Analytical expressions for\nconcentration and cumulative release are derived for all strata, enabling the\nexploration of parameter sensitivity -- such as coating permeability and\ninternal diffusivity -- on the overall release profile.\n  The resulting release curves provide mechanistic insight into the transport\nprocesses and offer design criteria for achieving controlled release. Model\npredictions are benchmarked against in vitro experimental data obtained under\nphysiologically relevant conditions, showing good agreement and validating the\nkey features of the model. The proposed model thus serves as a practical tool\nfor predicting the behaviour of composite coated particles, supporting\nperformance evaluation and the rational design of next-generation drug delivery\nsystems with reduced experimental effort.",

      "summary": "The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands\nimpose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in\nmodeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,\nwhich is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face\nchallenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with\nsubstantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in\nsolving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,\nthis study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic\nassignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair\nrouters rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.\nAdditionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward\nfunction based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution\nreliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with\nextensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.\nWhen implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better\nassignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than\nthat of conventional methods.",

      "summary": "3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in\nautonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric\ndetails and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single\nvehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and\nnarrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception\nenables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the\ncompleteness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for\ncollaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing\ncollaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a\nhigh-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive\noccupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying\nprediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial\nextent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that\nperforms inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention\naggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model\nconsistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as\nthe prediction range expands.",

As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the\nArtemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks\nsuch as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as\nexcavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but\nproposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry\ndrift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important\nfor upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on\nautonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To\nhelp overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an\napproach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for\nzero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment\ndetections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,\nwhich is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a\nprevious session using graph-theoretic data association.

      "summary": "Addressing complex societal challenges, such as improving public health,\nfostering honesty in workplaces, or encouraging eco-friendly behaviour requires\neffective nudges to influence human behaviour at scale. Intervention science\nseeks to design such nudges within complex societal systems. While\ninterventions primarily aim to shift the system toward a desired state, less\nattention is given to the sustainability of that state, which we define in\nterms of resilience: the system's ability to retain the desired state even\nunder perturbations. In this work, we offer a more holistic perspective to\nintervention design by incorporating a nature-inspired postulate i.e., lower\nenergy states tend to exhibit greater resilience, as a regularization mechanism\nwithin intervention optimization to ensure that the resulting state is also\nsustainable. Using a simple agent-based simulation where commuters are nudged\nto choose eco-friendly options (e.g., cycles) over individually attractive but\nless eco-friendly ones (e.g., cars), we demonstrate how embedding lower energy\npostulate into intervention design induces resilience. The system energy is\ndefined in terms of motivators that drive its agent's behaviour. By inherently\nensuring that agents are not pushed into actions that contradict their\nmotivators, the energy-based approach helps design effective interventions that\ncontribute to resilient behavioural states.",
