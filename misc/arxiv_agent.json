      "title": "Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands",
      "summary": "Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that\nlimit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these\ncoarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and\nintentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific\nitem attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in\ninaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a\npersistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately\nundermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation\nFeed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within\nmainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users\nto passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control\nover recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support\nthis paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser\nAgent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a\nPlanner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly\npolicy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ\nsimulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance\nwhile maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and\nlong-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both\nuser satisfaction and business outcomes.",

      "summary": "This paper presents Nova, a real-time scheduling framework for serving\nagentic vision-language models (VLMs) on a single GPU with balanced per-request\nlatency and overall request process throughput. Our design begins by enabling\neffective pipelining across vision encode, LLM prefill, and LLM decode stages\nof VLMs, by exploiting their heterogeneous resource demands during execution\nand incorporating elastic GPU spatial partitioning among stages to maximally\nutilize the compute and memory resources. Building on this, we introduce a\nreal-time scheduling algorithm that adaptively calibrates resource allocation\namong stages based on a Pareto-optimal analysis of the latency-throughput\ntrade-off, allowing the system to sustain responsiveness and resource\nefficiency under dynamic request loads. To further alleviate GPU memory\npressure, we design a lightweight weight offloading strategy for vision\nencoders that preserves inference efficiency with minimized memory overhead.\nExtensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world agent workloads\ndemonstrate that Nova consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines,\nimproving the maximum latency by up to 23.3%, while keeping competitive\nthroughput.",

      "title": "VC-Agent: An Interactive Agent for Customized Video Dataset Collection",
      "summary": "Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly\nimportant. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is\nextremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to\nexpedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive\nagent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly\nretrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,\nconsidering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways\nfor the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and\nconfirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large\nlanguage models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More\nimportantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when\nuser interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark\nfor personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study\nto verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video\ndataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.",

      "title": "\\LARGE GMP$^{3}$: Learning-Driven, Bellman-Guided Trajectory Planning\n  for UAVs in Real-Time on SE(3)",
      "summary": "We propose $\\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that\ngenerates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework\nextends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie\ngroup $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and\nrotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory\ninformation for improved convergence. $\\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a\ndistributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy\ninformation along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and\nshares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative\npolicy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under\nkinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control\nsoftware that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink\nprotocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and\nindoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in\nconstrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and\nsmooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

      "title": "Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced\nthe agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and\nmulti-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards\noften suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,\nwe propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped\nagent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the\ncomplete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search\nsampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of\ntokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory\nnaturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even\nusing only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped\nrelative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level\ngroup relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct\npreference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based\nRL method.",

      "title": "What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous\n  Meta-Cognitive Patterns",
      "summary": "We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language\nmodel (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous\nreason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables\nsustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs\nusing 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents\nspontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic\nproduction of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their\nown cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own\nnature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models\ndeterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model\nassessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when\nevaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings\nprovide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,\nestablishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error\nrecovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.",

      "summary": "Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle\ndialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models\n(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce\nredundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across\ndifferent granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem\n(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs\nwithin chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and\nsession-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated\nmemory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent\nand relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and\nLoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong\nbaselines in long-term conversational question answering.",

      "summary": "Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and\nefficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,\nanticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities\nthroughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent\nchallenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are\nlimited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly\ncomplex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a\npromising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge\ninto data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and\nobservational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can\nguide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning\nbiases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed\nloss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like\nmonotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to\nensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for\nestimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,\nand multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these\napproaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active\ndecision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn\nmaintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing\noperational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,\nsimulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.\nFinally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions\nfrom individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods\nincluding meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain\ngeneralization techniques ...",

      "title": "Hybrid RIS-Aided Digital Over-the-Air Computing for Edge AI Inference:\n  Joint Feature Quantization and Active-Passive Beamforming Design",
      "summary": "The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge inference by leveraging\nubiquitously deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models, facilitating\nintelligent environmental perception for a wide range of applications. A\ncritical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate\nmulti-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting\nperception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising\ntechnique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform\nsuperposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however,\nincompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of\nsimultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for\nenhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital\nAirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map\nhigh-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated\ninto symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp\ntransceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across\nagents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals.\nTo endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a\nsurrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of\nfeature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we\nformulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization,\nand develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit\nallocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and\nhybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy\nand uncertainty.",
