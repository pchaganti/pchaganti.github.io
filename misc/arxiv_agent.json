      "title": "LLM CHESS: Benchmarking Reasoning and Instruction-Following in LLMs through Chess",
      "summary": "We introduce LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework designed to probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in large language models (LLMs) through extended agentic interaction in the domain of chess. We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games.",

      "title": "Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments",
      "summary": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.",

      "title": "Fault-tolerant mutual-visibility: complexity and solutions for grid-like networks",
      "summary": "Networks are often modeled using graphs, and within this setting we introduce the notion of $k$-fault-tolerant mutual visibility. Informally, a set of vertices $X \\subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$.\n  This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable.\n  Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ and $ω(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not. Exact formulae for $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ are derived for several specific graph topologies, including grid-like networks such as cylinders and tori, and for diameter-two networks defined by Hamming graphs and by the direct product of complete graphs.",

      "title": "Order and shape dependence of mechanical relaxation in proliferating active matter",
      "summary": "Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape. In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics.",

      "title": "How Far Are We from Genuinely Useful Deep Research Agents?",
      "summary": "Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis. However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.",

      "title": "Agentic Policy Optimization via Instruction-Policy Co-Evolution",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.",

      "title": "An Empirical Study of Agent Developer Practices in AI Agent Frameworks",
      "summary": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.",

      "title": "Latent Debate: A Surrogate Framework for Interpreting LLM Thinking",
      "summary": "Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.",

While large language models have made automated report generation technically feasible, systematic research in this specific area remains notably absent, particularly lacking formal task definitions and corresponding benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we define the Automated Online Public Opinion Report Generation (OPOR-GEN) task and construct OPOR-BENCH, an event-centric dataset covering 463 crisis events with their corresponding news articles, social media posts, and a reference summary. To evaluate report quality, we propose OPOR-EVAL, a novel agent-based framework that simulates human expert evaluation by analyzing generated reports in context. Experiments with frontier models demonstrate that our framework achieves high correlation with human judgments. Our comprehensive task definition, benchmark dataset, and evaluation framework provide a solid foundation for future research in this critical domain.",

      "summary": "In this work, we propose that reasoning in knowledge graph (KG) networks can be guided by surprise minimization. Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories. This work-in-progress study explores whether distance-based surprise can extend recent work showing that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures.",

      "title": "COACH: Collaborative Agents for Contextual Highlighting - A Multi-Agent Framework for Sports Video Analysis",
      "summary": "Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct \"cognitive tool\" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page",

However, existing benchmarks primarily measure correctness, overlooking the diversity of methods behind solutions. True innovation depends not only on producing correct answers but also on the originality of the approach. We present InnoGym, the first benchmark and framework designed to systematically evaluate the innovation potential of AI agents. InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.",

      "title": "The Active and Noise-Tolerant Strategic Perceptron",
      "summary": "We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].",

      "title": "HiconAgent: History Context-aware Policy Optimization for GUI Agents",
      "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.",

      "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based agentic frameworks increasingly adopt the paradigm of dynamically generating task-specific agents. We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.",

Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.",

      "summary": "This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.",

      "summary": "Metal-organic framework (MOF) databases have grown rapidly through experimental deposition and large-scale literature extraction, but recent analyses show that nearly half of their entries contain substantial structural errors. These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space.

      "summary": "Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.",

      "summary": "Recently, there has been an increasing need to develop agents capable of solving multiple tasks within the same environment, especially when these tasks are naturally associated with language. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks.",
