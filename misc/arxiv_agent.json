      "title": "Outbidding and Outbluffing Elite Humans: Mastering Liar's Poker via\n  Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for\nenvironments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and\nreasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite\nhuman play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:\nmost hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple\nrounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players.",

      "summary": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the\nphysical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.",

      "summary": "Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but\nbuilding production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task.\nDeploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation\nand experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to\ninteract with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale.",

      "summary": "We consider the problem of fairly allocating the vertices of a graph among\n$n$ agents, where the value of a bundle is determined by its cut value -- the\nnumber of edges with exactly one endpoint in the bundle. This model naturally\ncaptures applications such as team formation and network partitioning, where\nvaluations are inherently non-monotonic: the marginal values may be positive,\nnegative, or zero depending on the composition of the bundle. We focus on the\nfairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and explore its\ncompatibility with several efficiency concepts such as Transfer Stability (TS)\nthat prohibits single-item transfers that benefit one agent without making the\nother worse-off. For general graphs, our results uncover a non-monotonic\nrelationship between the number of agents $n$ and the existence of allocations\nsatisfying EF1 and transfer stability (TS): such allocations always exist for\n$n=2$, may fail to exist for $n=3$, but exist again for all $n\\geq 4$. We\nfurther show that existence can be guaranteed for any $n$ by slightly weakening\nthe efficiency requirement or by restricting the graph to forests.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

      "title": "Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation\n  Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action\ndemonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations.",

      "title": "Manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learning for\n  Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning",
      "summary": "Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a\ncritical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding\ncollisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse\nmanifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional\nmulti-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for\nreal-world applications.

To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct\nuser-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and\nHaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type\nquestions.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext.

We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments\nto multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation\nand action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS\nachieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without\ncommunication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without\ncommunication.",

      "title": "Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi\n  on the future of blockchain oracles",
      "summary": "The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the\ninformation coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",
