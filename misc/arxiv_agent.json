      "title": "ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory",
      "summary": "With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent\nreal-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key\nlimitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction\nhistory, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We\npropose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable\nreasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed\nexperiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from\nReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,\nenabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful\nexperience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling\n(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up\nthe agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,\nthe agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive\nsignals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn\nguides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory\nand test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,\nReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store\nraw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness\nand efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish\nmemory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to\nself-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.",

      "summary": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual\nscene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw\nimage inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for\nhigh-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's\ncontextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple\nperspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging\ntext-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene\nunderstanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.\nWe evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in navigation performance.",

      "summary": "Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific\ndiscovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,\nrely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source\nmodels struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and\nlong-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This\npaper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe\ndesigned to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key\nchallenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient\ndata resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn\nrollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a\nrecursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and\ndifficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling\nstrategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically\nadjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a\nmemory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on\nDataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning\ndiverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic\ntasks.

      "summary": "This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address\nthe problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with\nmultiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit\nknowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions\nbased on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats\ngeometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception\nregions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable.\nThe proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near\nthese zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with\nmultiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function\n(log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones\nwhile prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and\nembedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects\nactuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several\ndefenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones\nand achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.",

      "summary": "The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex\nenvironments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement\nlearning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge\nopaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in\nwhich an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work\ndemonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only\nact effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world\nthrough explicit reasoning on raw experience.",

A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality\ndownstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and\nverifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human\nannotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,\nwhich is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited\ncoverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task\ngeneration that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover\npossible interactions and current state information to synthesize\nenvironment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration\nphase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment\nstates and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task\ngenerator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline\nprompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks.

      "summary": "As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose\ngrowing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management\ncritical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security.\nModern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading\nuncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These\nuncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental\nvariability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons\ndownstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional\ncentralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational\ncomplexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while\nexisting multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve\neffective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\npresent MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by\nstarling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,\nseparation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs\nto make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In\naddition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to\nadapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on\nreal-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\\%,\ncuts computation by 35\\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\\%, exhibiting\nsuper-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000\nnodes.

Progress in robust mobile\nmanipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich\nand long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque\nsensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this\ngap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset\nfor mobile manipulation.

      "summary": "Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing\nand testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity\nand realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit\nscenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to\ngenerate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their\nreliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for\na learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past\ntrajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be\navailable for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often\nproduce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly\nunder out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address\nthis, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for\ngenerating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories\nconditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.\nFurthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet\nframe candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant\ntrajectory generation.

DRCP\nintegrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,\na cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages\ncamera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and\nadaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)\nMask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement\nmodule that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns\nbird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed\nsystem achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly\nimproving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in\nlate 2025.",
