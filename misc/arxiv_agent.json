      "summary": "As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to\nautomatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We\npropose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,\nself-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.\nThe coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific\nentrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the\noutput of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only\nthe essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on\nGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate\nmodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially\nlarge code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models\nstruggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions\ntraces.",

      "summary": "AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and\nreasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value\nand automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a\nbroadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable\nprojects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical\nsettings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing\nagent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%.

      "title": "Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World\n  Models",
      "summary": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

      "title": "The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's\n  Safety and Autonomy",
      "summary": "As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how\nto retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.",

      "summary": "We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a\nnovel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair\ndecision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained\nsettings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.\nOur approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and\nfairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method\ncomputes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual\nadvantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off\nagents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where\nan arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,\nhomelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover\nfar-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by\na theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower\nbound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers\nmonotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled\nframework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve\nmore equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.",

We\nintroduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization\nservers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and\nissue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the\nagents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on\ndelegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically\nappropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce\nASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic\nmatching between tasks and scopes.

However,\nupdating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone\nprocess. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding\nsystems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this\npaper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,\nacross a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's\nCopilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing\nmulti-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated\nmigration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the\nproportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study\nshow that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages\nbetween SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to\nmaintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate\n(39.75%, median).",

To realize this vision, we introduce\nasynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large\nlanguage models, which organizes the internal thinking process into\nconcurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking\nprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges\nintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions.

      "summary": "In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain\ndistribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment\nconditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

We\nintroduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding\nmulti-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.\nSlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three\nspecialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,\nquery-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and\ndetailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively\nactivates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their\noutputs into coherent, context-aware answers.

In this paper, we propose a\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to\nenhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This\napproach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant\ntext, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.\nThese two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic\ninformation to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to\ndynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant\nsemantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the\nlegitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's\nperformance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose\nan alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated\niteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the\nencryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method\nachieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak\nsignalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.",

To achieve this, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a\npromising solution for emergency communication due to its low cost and\ndeployment flexibility. However, conventional untethered UAV (U-UAV) is\nconstrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, making it incapable\nof maintaining the operation of a macro base station. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a heterogeneous UAV-based framework that integrates\ntethered UAV (T-UAV) and U-UAVs, where U-UAVs are utilized to enhance the\nthroughput of cell-edge ground user equipments (G-UEs) and guarantee seamless\nconnectivity during G-UEs' mobility to safe zones.

      "summary": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social\nrelations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are\nfundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which\ncontexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future.

By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for\na broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.",
