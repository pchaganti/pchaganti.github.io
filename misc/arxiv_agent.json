      "title": "A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for\n  Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model",
      "summary": "We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning\nfinite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes\n(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This\nmatches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.\n(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other\nparameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For\ninfinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we\npropose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to\nwhich our quantum algorithms have $\\operatorname{poly}\\log{T}$ regret,\nexponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise\nall of our results to compact state spaces.",

      "title": "Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method",
      "summary": "We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method\n(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked\nmulti-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where\neach agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the\nchallenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions\nthrough row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative\nestimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a\ncentral aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local\nembeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent\nprivacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise\nadditions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that\nexplicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical\nanalysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,\nprovides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs\ncompared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in\nmoderate privacy regimes ($\\epsilon\\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,\nallowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while\nmaintaining competitive utility.",

      "title": "RLVMR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Meta-Reasoning Rewards for\n  Robust Long-Horizon Agents",
      "summary": "The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a\ncentral goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical\nlimitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final\ntask success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem\nwe term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail\nto generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason\ncoherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that\nintegrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding\nverifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag\nits cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and\nprovides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to\neffective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the\nfinal outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.\nOn the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on\nthe most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem\nfrom improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant\nactions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and\ninterpretable agents.",

However, NL plans\nare inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into\nexecutable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for\nmulti-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured\nrepresentations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by\nformalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that\nformalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to\ngenerate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps\ninto SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel\nexecution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our\nmethod explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.\nExperiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms\nprior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the\nadvantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.",

      "summary": "Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end\ncode holds significant promise for accelerating software development and\ndemocratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,\nstructural coherence, and code correctness.

      "summary": "In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of\nmicroservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more\nfrequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause\nAnalysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of\nincidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating\nand recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization\nability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are\nbased on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM\nand the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization\nresults. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in\nlarge, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length\nof LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative\nLLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base\nreward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to\nState-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration\napproach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,\nrequiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a\nrule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates\nhallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA\nframework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause\nlocalization accuracy.",

While traditional models are often based\non the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting\nevery other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous\nmixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies\nand computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating\nhigh-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly\nimproving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk\nassessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides\na comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed\nepidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human\nmobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility\nand contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review\nspans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical\ncompartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning\nmodels. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management\nand response strategies during epidemics.

This paper\nshows that a belief sequence is consistent with misspecified Bayesianism if the\nprior contains a grain of the average posterior, i.e., is a mixture of the\naverage posterior and another distribution. A partition-based variant of the\ngrain condition is both necessary and sufficient. Under correct specification,\nthe grain condition reduces to the usual Bayes plausibility.
