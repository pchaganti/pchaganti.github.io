      "title": "Moving Out: Physically-grounded Human-AI Collaboration",
      "summary": "The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is\ncrucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with\nhumans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the\nincreased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained\ndynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a\nwide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and\nconstraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent\nactions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two\ntasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities\nto adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address\nthe challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS\n(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of\nagents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show\nthat BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI\ncollaboration.

      "title": "Explainable Mapper: Charting LLM Embedding Spaces Using\n  Perturbation-Based Explanation and Verification Agents",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture\nrich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and\nconcepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We\ninstantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate\nits effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings\nfrom prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its\narchitecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of\ntopological neighborhoods.",

      "summary": "Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for\nautonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and\nplanning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant\nnetwork architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects\n(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these\nmethods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,\nrequiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)\ninvariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to\nthe number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer\narchitecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large\nlanguage models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our\napproach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to\ncomparable non-invariant architectures.",

Recent generative AI models present\nopportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they\nmay be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster\ndesign assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven\npersona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers\nfeedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates\ndiscussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These\nagreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.\nThrough our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to\ncapture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.\nAdditionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the\nfeedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona\nidentity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona\nagents' perspectives.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,\nwhere High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,\nreducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the\nreliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While\nincorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has\nshown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide\nlimited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is\nbeneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which\nmapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction\nand identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic\nstate. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario\nGating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction\nbased on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,\nself-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and\ntrajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is\nadvantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with\nmap geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%\nimprovement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the\nstate-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

Built from publicly\navailable datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs\nspanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic\nalignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.

      "title": "Remembering the Markov Property in Cooperative MARL",
      "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised\nas a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),\nwhere agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In\npractice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function\napproximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial\ninformation. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of\nthese methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to\nlearning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.\nThrough a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn\nbrittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.\nCrucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design\nnecessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of\nthe learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also\nsuggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core\nassumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative\nenvironments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in\nobservations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring\nsuccess requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.",

Post-interaction evaluations indicated that\nparticipants perceived the disfluent agent as more competent, despite no\nsignificant differences in pre-task ratings.

      "summary": "We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$\nagents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent\n$i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i > b_i > 0$ to each good, indicating\nthat agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For\nconvenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.\n  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our\ncharacterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given\nallocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the\ngeneral case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision\nproblem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this\ndecision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's\nvalue for each good belongs to $\\{a,b,c\\}$ for some prescribed $a>b>c\\geq0$),\nand this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in\nour model is the same for each agent).\n  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in\npolynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which\nextends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem\nof whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be\ncomputed in polynomial time).",

      "summary": "The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a\nfundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the\nemergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume\natomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive\nsingle-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of\nits environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a\nsearch-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL\nagent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify\na parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and\nRL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a\ncalibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a\nrepresentative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost\nfunction to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm\nconverges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with\nthe competitive equilibrium.
