      "title": "Flipping Against All Odds: Reducing LLM Coin Flip Bias via Verbalized\n  Rejection Sampling",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability\ndistributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate\nfaithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring\nreliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,\nand randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and\nsampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized\nRejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection\nsampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed\nsamples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS\nsubstantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical\nanalysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct\nsampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More\nbroadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized\nand embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring\naccess to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.",

      "title": "SRLAgent: Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Skills through Gamification\n  and LLM Assistance",
      "summary": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for college students navigating\nincreased academic demands and independence. Insufficient SRL skills can lead\nto disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,\nundermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a\nformative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges\nstudents face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with\ngoal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL\nskills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models\n(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables\nstudents to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection\nwithin an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time\nfeedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study\nefforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to\na baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia\nlearning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills\nwithin the SRLAgent group (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement\ncompared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL\nscaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering\ndesign implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper\nlearning and metacognitive skill development.",

      "title": "The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with\n  Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability",
      "summary": "Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,\nespecially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents\ntailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.\nThese strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding\nvariables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant\nchallenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target\nenvironments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where\nempirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper\nexplores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.\nactions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We\npresent a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system\ndynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of\nknowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an\nonline strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$.",

      "title": "On the Linear Programming Model for Dynamic Stochastic Matching and Its\n  Application on Pricing",
      "summary": "Important pricing problems in centralized matching markets -- such as\ncarpooling and food delivery platforms -- often exhibit a bi-level structure.\nAt the upper level, the platform sets prices for different types of agents\n(e.g., riders with various origins and destinations, or delivery orders from\ndiverse restaurants to customer locations). The lower level then matches\nconverted agents to minimize operational costs, such as pooling riders with\nsimilar itineraries into the same vehicle or consolidating multiple delivery\norders into a single trip. Motivated by these applications, we study the\noptimal value (cost) function of a linear programming model with respect to\nagent arrival rates, originally proposed by Aouad and Saritac (2022) for\ncost-minimizing dynamic stochastic matching under limited time. In particular,\nwe investigate the concavity of this cost function. We show that weak concavity\nholds when there are fewer than or equal to three agent types with identical\npatience level. For an arbitrary number of agent types, (weak) concavity is\nmore likely to hold when agents have high or similar patience, or when agents\nare more heterogeneous in their matching efficiencies. Building on these\ntheoretical insights, we develop a Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm for the\npricing problem that requires little stepsize tuning, and demonstrate\nsubstantial performance improvements over projected gradient-based methods on a\nlarge-scale, real-world ridesharing dataset. This makes it a compelling\nalgorithmic choice for solving such pricing problems in practice.",

To address this, we\nintroduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization\nin task-oriented AI assistants.

DNA seeks a set of reasonable \"options\" for\ntrajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively\ndiverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these\ndistinct policies are used to \"explain\" an agent's options in terms of\navailable trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,\nDNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where\nagents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which\nuses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for\ndistinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality.

      "title": "OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation",
      "summary": "Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit\nof embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different\ntasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task\nobjectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed\nindividually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,\nwhich can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of\nmulti-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale\nbenchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.\nSpecifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed\nvia a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory\npairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and\ncapability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within\nOctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,\nwe build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce\nlow-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a\nHybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,\nAction-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains\nspecifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT\nand Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which\nshow impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to\ninvestigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation\nfield, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,\nwe propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a\ncold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.\nFinally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.",

      "summary": "Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the\npattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide\nneedle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning\nstage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan\nquality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of\none selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined\nreward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent\nthen moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric\nmetrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the\nclinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical\nplans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no\nstatistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate\nV150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans\nuse 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the\nfirst study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to\nautonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.\nThis RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to\nconventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal\ndata requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial\npotential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,\nand enhance patient outcomes.",

      "title": "Delegations as Adaptive Representation Patterns: Rethinking Influence in\n  Liquid Democracy",
      "summary": "Liquid democracy is a mechanism for the division of labor in decision-making\nthrough the transitive delegation of influence. In essence, all individuals\npossess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage\ndirectly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their\nchoosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging\nin liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the\ncapacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified\nas a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.\n  Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the\nLiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence\nof voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the\nprocess nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting\nare distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel\nmodel of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact\ncontribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and\ndecision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for\nall votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is\nstemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an\nexponential trajectory.\n  In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous\nanalysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process.\nThe adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the\nexisting academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most\nimportant features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on\nthis aspect of liquid democracy.",

The recent emergence of Foundation Models\n(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general\nknowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for\nfurther transformation in engineering design.

      "summary": "Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect\nto a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in\nvarious applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation\nsatellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute\nlocalization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference\nsatellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied\nscenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level\nimage matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences\nintroduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome\nthese limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source\nimage matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates\na semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a\nlightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching\nmodule, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first\nestablish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural\nconstraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine\nfeatures and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV\nabsolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on\nrelative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module\nbefore the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental\nevaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset\ndemonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under\nvarious challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.",

      "summary": "Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is\ncrucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability\noutputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive\narchitecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to\nagents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the\ninterpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision\nProcedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:\nRefactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data\nrepresentation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus\non salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant\ninformation. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,\nand Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This\nprocess leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on\nLLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.\nThe combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM\nutilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing\nhighly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher\naccuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.",

      "summary": "Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large\nLanguage Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance.

Based on this strategy, we train\nReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the\nprior best by 4.17\\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\\%.",
