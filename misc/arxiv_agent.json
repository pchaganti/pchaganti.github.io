      "title": "StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams",
      "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous\nagents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video\nstreams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

      "title": "MODE: Learning compositional representations of complex systems with\n  Mixtures Of Dynamical Experts",
      "summary": "Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures\nof overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from\ncycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental\nfates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,\nposing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which\nassume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE\n(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural\ngating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable\ncomponents, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and\naccurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because\nagents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is\nespecially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we\ndeploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it\ncan not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also\npredict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding\nchallenge in computational biology.",

Titles\nand abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a\nhand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained\ncues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and\nco-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a\nsharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes\nclassic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)\nsteady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating\naround controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video\nactivity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a\ngrowing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,\nparameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight\nvision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building\nencoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;\ncontrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and\ndistillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and\nICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or\nrobustness diffuse across areas.

      "summary": "Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as\nmath and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding\ncontrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such\nas web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human\ncognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -\nthe capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order\nto enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive\nenvironments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that\nexplicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their\nreasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which\ntrains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search\ntrees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.\nReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips\nit with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,\nwe propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further\nstrengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both\noutcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.\nExperiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one\nrealistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively\ninfuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome\nand interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,\nplanning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of\nsimulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in\nthe ever more challenging environments.",

We present a biologically inspired,\nActive Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning\n(AIMAPP).

Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses\ntopological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide\nbehaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns\nstate transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free\nEnergy.

To streamline this\nprocess and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic\nPromotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,\nengaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release\nPRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to\nhigh-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity\n(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment\n(timing and channel optimization).

While modern Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in\nembodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent\nof their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge\nthis gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating\nthe comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.\nIt assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool\nRecognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function.

Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of\nonline interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We\naddress these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and\nestablish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under\ngeneral function approximations for both expert data and reward-free\ninteractions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result\nthat can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and\ntherefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with\nsecond-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed\nhard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample\ncomplexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited\nexpert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in\nterms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy\nvariance $\\sigma^2$.

As these\nLLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such\npolicies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly\ncomplex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large\nfixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that\ngovern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.\nPrior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and\ndemonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on\ntext-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),\na new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model\nparameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy\nduring inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build\ntwo datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using\ntasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework.

      "summary": "Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and\nautonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while\navoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global\ninformation, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality\nsolutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to\nthe combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,\ndistributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based\nmethods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information\navailability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path\nplanning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to\nadapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static\nconflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared\ninformation from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We\nempirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its\nplanning performance.

Prior work treats this as a\nsecurity problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context\nto subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,\nmost AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can\nbecome a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted\nmodel that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the\nuntrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for\nthis information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector\nby which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in\nthe model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade\ndiverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control\nbenchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on\na monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,\nas its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as\na best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent\na major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard\ncomponent of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.",

      "summary": "Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is\na central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily\noperate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring\nretraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward\ninference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume\naccess to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third\nparty stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we\npropose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does\nnot require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof\nof concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but\nuninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate\nthis dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures\nthe optimal balance between safety and helpfulness.
