      "title": "4KAgent: Agentic Any Image to 4K Super-Resolution",
      "summary": "We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system\ndesigned to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if\napplied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low\nresolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at\n256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three\ncore components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline\nbased on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages\nvision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze\nthe input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration\nAgent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection\nparadigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the\noptimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face\nrestoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and\nselfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task\ncategories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new\nstate-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover\nnatural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,\nfluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and\nX-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,\nNIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic\nparadigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and\ninnovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research\ncommunities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:\nhttps://4kagent.github.io.",

      "title": "Graph-Based Complexity Metrics for Multi-Agent Curriculum Learning: A\n  Validated Approach to Task Ordering in Cooperative Coordination Environments",
      "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces significant challenges in\ntask sequencing and curriculum design, particularly for cooperative\ncoordination scenarios. While curriculum learning has demonstrated success in\nsingle-agent domains, principled approaches for multi-agent coordination remain\nlimited due to the absence of validated task complexity metrics. This approach\npresents a graph-based coordination complexity metric that integrates agent\ndependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to\npredict task difficulty in multi-agent environments. The complexity metric\nachieves strong empirical validation with rho = 0.952 correlation (p < 0.001)\nbetween predicted complexity and empirical difficulty determined by random\nagent performance evaluation. This approach evaluates the curriculum learning\nframework using MADDPG across two distinct coordination environments: achieving\n56x performance improvement in tight coordination tasks (MultiWalker) and\ndemonstrating systematic task progression in cooperative navigation (Simple\nSpread). Through systematic analysis, coordination tightness emerges as a\npredictor of curriculum learning effectiveness, where environments requiring\nstrict agent interdependence benefit substantially from structured progression.\nThis approach provides a validated complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum\ndesign and establishes empirical guidelines for multi-robot coordination\napplications.",

      "summary": "We consider the problem of decomposing a piecewise constant function on the\ncircle into a sum of indicator functions of closed circular disks in the plane,\nwhose number and location are not a priori known. This represents a situation\nwhere an agent moving on the circle is able to sense its proximity to some\nlandmarks, and the goal is to estimate the number of these landmarks and their\npossible locations -- which can in turn enable control tasks such as motion\nplanning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the exact values of the function at\nits discontinuities (which correspond to disk boundaries for the individual\nindicator functions) are not assumed to be known to the agent. We introduce\nsuitable notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to single out those\ndecompositions that are more desirable, or more likely, given this non-precise\ndata collected by the agent. We provide a characterization of robust\ndecompositions and give a procedure for generating all such decompositions.\nWhen the given function admits a robust decomposition, we compute the number of\npossible robust decompositions and derive bounds for the number of\ndecompositions maximizing the degrees of freedom.",

At each\ncell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent\nthat interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of\nlegitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts\nto intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its\nauthorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only\nshare their network parameters with a central server and not the private data\nof their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and\nReinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results\ndemonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach.\nFurthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and\ncomplexity.",

      "summary": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve\nthe physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN)\nover cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks\nsuch as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims\nto intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver\nhas full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals\nto confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter\nextracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power\nsubsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and\nreliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized\nwhere multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each\nSU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal\ntransmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages\nduring each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we\npropose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting\nthe interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user.\nAccording to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline\nstrategies in terms of security and reliability.",

However, few works\nhave studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we\ninvestigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to\npredict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two\nmath tutoring dialogue datasets.

However, traditional\ndata-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving\nnature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we\npropose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that\ndoes not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We\nretrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual\ninformation. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to\nextract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a\nmulti-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned\narbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also\nshows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter\nscales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection.

      "summary": "Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of\nmoving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of\nautonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene\nunderstanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse\nweather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome\nthese limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by\nmeasuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and\nnoisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse\nradar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called\nSemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and\noptimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy.

      "summary": "Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial\nmarkets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high\nvelocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding\nwindow techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size\nwindows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty\npatterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based\napproach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional\ndata streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable\nan agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as\nvariance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a\nDueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle\nnon-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets\n(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo!

Additional\nqualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and\na comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and\nstability, making it suitable for real-time applications.",

      "title": "VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual\n  Grounding Manipulation",
      "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine\ninteractions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile\nphones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks\nin a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents.",

      "summary": "Classical sampling-based motion planners like the RRTs suffer from\ninefficiencies, particularly in cluttered or high-dimensional spaces, due to\ntheir reliance on undirected, random sampling. This paper introduces the\nEpisodic RRT, a novel hybrid planning framework that replaces the primitive of\na random point with a learned, multi-step \"exploratory episode\" generated by a\nDeep Reinforcement Learning agent. By making the DRL agent the engine of\nexploration, ERRT transforms the search process from a diffuse, volumetric\nexpansion into a directed, branch-like growth. This paradigm shift yields key\nadvantages: it counters the curse of dimensionality with focused exploration,\nminimizes expensive collision checks by proactively proposing locally valid\npaths, and improves connectivity by generating inherently connected path\nsegments.

While RL can surpass\nsuch heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and\nunpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.\nData-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading\nperformance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a\ngeneralization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell\ntopology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)\napplies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)\ndistributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training\nin a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although\ngeneralization increases computational and data-management complexity, our\ndistributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training\nacross diverse network conditions.
