      "title": "G1: Bootstrapping Perception and Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language\n  Model via Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but\nstruggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within\ninteractive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap\nsignificantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs\noften performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym,\na curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual\ngames with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty,\nspecifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging\nVLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which\ndemonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate\nchallenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a\nperception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models\nconsistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading\nproprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals\nan intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap\neach other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym\nand RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster\nfuture research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.",
