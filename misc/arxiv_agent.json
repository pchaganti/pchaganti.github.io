      "title": "WorldLens: Full-Spectrum Evaluations of Driving World Models in Real World",
      "summary": "Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.",

      "title": "On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes",
      "summary": "We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.",

      "title": "Curriculum-Based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous UAV Navigation in Unknown Curved Tubular Conduit",
      "summary": "Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.",

      "title": "Asynchronous Reasoning: Training-Free Interactive Thinking LLMs",
      "summary": "Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.",

      "summary": "Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types. We present CompanionCast, a general framework for orchestrating multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. Distinctly, CompanionCast integrates an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions (relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, personality consistency). We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.",

      "title": "Designing Truthful Mechanisms for Asymptotic Fair Division",
      "summary": "We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of $m$ goods among $n$ agents in the asymptotic setting, where each item's value for each agent is drawn from an underlying joint distribution. Prior works have shown that if this distribution is well-behaved, then an envy-free allocation exists with high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$ [Dickerson et al., 2014]. Under the stronger assumption that item values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across agents, this requirement improves to $m=Ω(n\\log{n}/\\log{\\log{n}})$, which is tight [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2021]. However, these results rely on non-strategyproof mechanisms, such as maximum-welfare allocation or the round-robin algorithm, limiting their applicability in settings with strategic agents.\n  In this work, we extend the theory to a broader, more realistic class of joint value distributions, allowing for correlations among agents, atomicity, and unequal probabilities of having the highest value for an item. We show that envy-free allocations continue to exist with a high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$. More importantly, we give a new randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation, efficiently implementable in polynomial time, and outputs envy-free allocations with high probability, answering an open question posed by [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2017]. We further extend our mechanism to settings with asymptotic weighted fair division and multiple agent types and good types, proving new results in each case.",

      "title": "Learning Controllable and Diverse Player Behaviors in Multi-Agent Environments",
      "summary": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.",

      "title": "Long-horizon Reasoning Agent for Olympiad-Level Mathematical Problem Solving",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \\textsc{\\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\\% to 73.3\\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.",

      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.",

Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations. Code: https://github.com/mebbaid/paper-elobaid-ifacwc-2026",

      "summary": "Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize \"how-to\" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a \"passive accumulation\" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.",

This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.",

      "title": "Strong Global Convergence of the Consensus-Based Optimization Algorithm",
      "summary": "Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization algorithm that has proven to be capable of globally minimizing nonconvex nonsmooth functions across a diverse range of applications while being amenable to theoretical analysis. The method leverages an interplay between exploration of the energy landscape of the objective function through a system of interacting particles subject to stochasticity and exploitation of the particles' positions through the computation of a global consensus about the location of the minimizer based on the Laplace principle. In this paper, we prove strong mean square convergence of the practical numerical time-discrete CBO algorithm to the global minimizer for a rich class of objective functions. For CBO with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, our convergence result features conditions on the choice of the hyperparameters as well as explicit rates of convergence in the time discretization step size $Δt$ and the number of particles $N$. By interpreting the time-discrete algorithm at the continuous-time level through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), our proof strategy combines traditional finite-time convergence theory for numerical methods applied to SDEs with careful considerations due to the fact that the CBO coefficients do not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. To accomodate the latter, we adopt a recently proposed generalization of Sznitman's classical argument, which allows to discard an event of small probability, controllable through fine moment estimates for the particle systems.",

However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message. Three core linear operations, equality (branching), addition, and multiplication, are realized in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models. Validation against the standard sum-product algorithm shows accurate message updates, while applications to Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression demonstrate the framework's potential for both static and dynamic inference tasks.

To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager.

High-income individuals benefit from the fast-track access, while low-income individuals are worse off and remain in the free line. Middle-income individuals weakly prefer the single free queue; yet, under the priority regime, they pay for fast-track access.

      "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions.
