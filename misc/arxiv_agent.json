      "title": "Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding",
      "summary": "Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a\ncentral part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and\nreasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing\nconcern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on\nsingle-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts\ndynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion\nstrategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our\nfindings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level\ncontrol frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational\ndeception powered by generative AI.",

In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents\nwith a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory.

      "title": "When AIOps Become \"AI Oops\": Subverting LLM-driven IT Operations via\n  Telemetry Manipulation",
      "summary": "AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex\nsoftware systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and\nremediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based\nagents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal\nhuman intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost\nsavings.\n  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions,\nshowing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security\ncost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to\nmislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the\ninfrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject\ntelemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior\nthrough a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system\nerror interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack\nmethodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing,\nand LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior\nknowledge of the target system.\n  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that\nsanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal\nrole of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably\nblocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.\n  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system\ncompromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.",

      "summary": "Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database\nlanguage, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.\nTraditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a\ngiven Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation\naccuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is\npre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive\ndatabases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet\noverlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL\nframework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL\nqueries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit\ninformation from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We\nthen train a large db\\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based\nfinetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\\_id) based on\nboth the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL\nby using critic agents to correct errors.

      "title": "Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign\n  Prompts",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,\nplanning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical\nconcern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the\nmost advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when\nhandling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM\nagents in complex and crucial domains.",

Specifically, we assume that the goods are\nrepresented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to\nthe agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the\nwidely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an\nallocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity\nconstraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is\nnatural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected\nbundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share\nvalue to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as\ncomplete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such\napproximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether\nthey exist for the class of all graphs.\n  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of\napproximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show\nthat such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block\ngraphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.",

UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically\nmixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them\nusing a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the\nego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with\nunsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully\nunsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a\ncooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the\nOvercooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner\ncurriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both\npopulation-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user\nstudy, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and\nwas perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better\ncollaborator, and less frustrating.",

      "summary": "The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources\nyields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing\nsupply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due\nto capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned\nbatteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation\npotential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the\ndecision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice\nby each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an\nanalysis from a game-theoretic point of view.\n  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic\nsetting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries\nto increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market\nmodel where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize\nrenewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we\nstudy the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing\nstrategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the\nchosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls\nfor more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich\nfield for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable\nenergy networks.",

However, integrating\npowerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In\nparticular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling\nefficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical\nin time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these\ndifficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel\noffline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To\naddress the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,\nwe introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a\ncarefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.\nAdditionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a\nderivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve\ntraining stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo\nbenchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a\n3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.\nOur approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model\ninto offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative\npolicies in cooperative multi-agent settings.",

In hate speech detection, this transforms the\ntask from \"is this hate speech?\" to \"does this violate the hate speech policy?\"\n  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates\nthis approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification\naccuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability\nvia retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model\nretraining.

      "summary": "With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new\nthreat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions\nare injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.
