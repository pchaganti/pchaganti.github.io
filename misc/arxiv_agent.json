      "title": "On the Same Wavelength? Evaluating Pragmatic Reasoning in Language\n  Models across Broad Concepts",
      "summary": "Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative\ngoals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as\nconversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their\npragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from\nWavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener\ncommunicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a\nrange of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using\ndirect and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational\nSpeech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM\ninference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve\nstrong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human\naccuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT\nprompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,\nand using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study\nhelps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning\nabilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening\nup future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language\nunderstanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.",

      "summary": "Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit\nfundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to\nnon-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding\nanalyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives.\nNeuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize\ncybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this\nemerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity\nchallenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning,\nenabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous\noffensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we\nsystematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning\n2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A)\nframework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber\noffense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our\nanalysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies\ncritical implementation challenges including standardization gaps,\ncomputational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that\nconstrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most\ntransformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based\napproaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous\nsystems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while\nachieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide\ninsights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for\ncommunity-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development\npractices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives\nwhile maintaining societal alignment.",

      "title": "Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI\n  Agents",
      "summary": "We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research\npapers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists.",

      "summary": "Motile nanosized particles, or \"nanobots\", promise more effective and less\ntoxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We\nconsider the case in which the cancer is \"diffuse\", dispersed such that there\nare multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of\nnanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at\nthe sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be\nallocated between sites according to their \"demands\"; this requires extra\nnanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the\nnanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement\nmodel for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in\nwhich bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three\nalgorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of\nreality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that\nsurround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional\nchemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third\nalgorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts\nthe other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that\nthey are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present\nsimulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer\narrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless\nthe natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses\ntoo slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment\nspeed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.\nFor KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer\npatterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.",

      "summary": "Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed\ndatasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling\ntechniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several\ndrawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,\nlimit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To\novercome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based\napproach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex\ninteractions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE\nimplements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve\ncorrelations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for\nmeaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic\ninterpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.\nExperiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion\ndynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic\nbiases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such\nbiases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an\nagreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an\nanchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to\nmulti-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge\nto a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time,\nand the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an\nLLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation)\nand demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing\nstark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them\nto human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and\npitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.",

      "title": "Reinforcement learning meets bioprocess control through behaviour\n  cloning: Real-world deployment in an industrial photobioreactor",
      "summary": "The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major\nchallenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially\nin open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address\nthis, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with\nBehavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control\nstrategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method\nbegins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from\ntrajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed\nby a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid\noffline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable\nof handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open\nPBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral\nof Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%\nrelative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased\nsubstantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an\nimportant factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day\nexperimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the\nrobustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work\ndemonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves\nthe way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone\nsystems.",

      "title": "RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems",
      "summary": "We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of\nlong-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to\nidentify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that\ncurrently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that\nthey often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,\nand are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match\nthe agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,\nprobe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems\nover long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation\narchitecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.\nSpecifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using\na central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized\nEvaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of\nthe reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These\nresults demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection\nfor autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.",

      "title": "Reward function compression facilitates goal-dependent reinforcement\n  learning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely\nassign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However,\nthis flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here,\nwe propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a\ncapacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners\ncreate a \"compressed\" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal)\nwhich is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon\nreceiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting\nlearning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent\nwith our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically\nimpaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space\nstructure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to\ncorrelate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal\nvaluation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We\nleverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work\nsuggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex\ngoal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive\nmechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the\nneuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral\ntechniques that support people in achieving their goals.",

SL must share licensed\nspectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi,\nposing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or\nthreshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives\nqueueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its\npolicy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our\nframework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based\nscheduling under limited licensed bandwidth.

      "summary": "The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated\nSensing and Communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks enables dynamic spatial\nresource management and real-time adaptation to environmental changes. However,\nthe coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly\ndynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges\nfor unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these\nissues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep\nreinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in\nRIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically,\nwe introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that\ncharacterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the\nprobabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous\nreliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode\ncomplex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among\nvehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then\nprocessed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel\nallocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven\nlong-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets\ndemonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms\nof continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling\npersistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.",

By defining the origin as the desired collective opinion of\nthe society, the objective of the paper is to minimize deviations from this\ndesired opinion. To achieve this, a Stackelberg game is established between the\nstubborn and regular subgroups, where the opinion adjustments of the stubborn\nagents and the openness variables of regular agents serve as the decision\nvariables.

A central element of this process is the patient summary,\ntypically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,\nor their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records\ninto a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is\noften labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical\ninformation.

Evaluating predicted patient\nsummaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic\nvariation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate\nthe measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these\nevaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework\ndesigned to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated\nsummaries.

The optimization\nsolution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus\nalgorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is\ntypically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but\nthey exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL,\nthe generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the\noptimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily\nconverge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The\nproposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along\nwith the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the\ncoupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the\nalgorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies\nthat at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the\ndemand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the\nalgorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show\nthat our solution can tolerate communication link removal.
