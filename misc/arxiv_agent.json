      "summary": "Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially\nimproves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world\ntasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited\nlong-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of\nsufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present\nDeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to\nautomatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from\nopen knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search.\nExperiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive\nresult on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and\nSearch-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search\nability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across\nmultiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool\ncalls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly\navailable at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.",

      "summary": "To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that\nenables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises\nthree specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the\nedge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model\nhosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an\nautomated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings,\nwe introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate\nand enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain\ncoding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks,\nRefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including\nSoftware Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language\nProcessing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive\nexperiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source\nand commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations\nfurther validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the\ngenerated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as\nthroughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance\ncharacteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.",

      "summary": "Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving,\nessential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However,\ntraditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and\nexhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training\nframework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing\nmethods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework\ndecouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction,\nprioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation\nfor downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates\ncontext-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion\npretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional\nreasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on\nthe Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and\nthe results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion\nforecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context\nautoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving.\nThe code and models will be made publicly available.",

      "title": "Mutual Information Tracks Policy Coherence in Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face\ndegradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet\nlack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an\ninformation-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of\nRL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.\nThrough analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic\ncontrol task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits\ncharacteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and\nactions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing\nstate entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention\nto task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns\nas both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the\nfoundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and\npolicy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.",

      "title": "Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure\n  Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems",
      "summary": "Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step\nwhere a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current\nmethods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,\nleading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\\%), which renders them\nimpractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the\nWho\\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated\ndataset, A2P achieves 47.46\\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\\times$ improvement\nover the 16.67\\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it\nachieves 29.31\\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\\times$ improvement over the baseline's\n12.07\\%.

      "summary": "We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments\ntailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper\ntraining space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users.\nRecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user\nand an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at\nmaximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items,\nupdates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates\nreflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by\nincorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic\nfeedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the\nexceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content\nrepresentations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and\nsemantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to\nrefine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports\nmulti-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of\ntargeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender\nsystems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information\nstreams. We envision new interaction paradigms where \"user instructs,\nrecommender responds,\" jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.",

      "title": "Physics-informed sensor coverage through structure preserving machine\n  learning",
      "summary": "We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in\nwhich agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled\nhydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data\nassimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms\n(CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus\n(FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves\ndiscrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It\nemploys a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form\nbasis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible\nwith given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model\nretains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation,\nyielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the\nsource field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating\nthe digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with\nanalysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage\nfunctional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within\nan optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under\ncontinuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient\ncondition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic\ntransformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when\nphysical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation\nprovides an effective inductive bias for source identification.",

The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional\nsystems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations\ninclude manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot\nbehavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a\ntwo-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal\naction tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures\ncoordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions,\nas well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main\noperations, contributing to more natural robot behavior.

      "summary": "The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a\nfleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their\ngoals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots\nexecuting the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk.\nAlthough robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the\npresence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the\nduration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become\nsignificant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the\noriginal plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan\nwhich will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide\nwhen to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this\npaper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans,\nits monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called\nAction Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution\nduration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the\npotential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We\nempirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator\nwhich we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous\nwarehouse robotic fleet.",

CARENLI routes each\npremise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable\nprocedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner.\n  Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching\n98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction.

This paper introduces a novel\nFederated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that\nincorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application\nlayer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource\nmanagement across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent\nQ-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum\naccess, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue\nlength, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a\nsecure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key\nexchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to\nsemi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a\npartially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a\nmulti-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy\nefficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific\nservice requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC.

Sample-based\nmethods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely\nadopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative\nmodel. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned\nfrom limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade\nperformance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust\nMDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,\nyet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited\nfor real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the\nfirst online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical\nperformance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal\nvalue function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the\nefficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA),\nenabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings.
