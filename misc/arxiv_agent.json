      "title": "SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via\n  Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can\ndevelop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable\nrewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and\ndomain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development.",

Our proof uses the notion\nof typed terms and well-typed proofs, and removes a restriction on the class of\nprotocols to which the [CKRT05] proof applies, by introducing a slightly\ndifferent (but very natural) notion of protocols, where honest agent sends are\nderivable from previous receives in the same session.",

      "title": "Agent.xpu: Efficient Scheduling of Agentic LLM Workloads on\n  Heterogeneous SoC",
      "summary": "The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices\nintroduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.\nReactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,\nwhile proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing\non-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently\nmanage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade\nheterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces\nAgent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on\nmemory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu\nfirst constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model\nkernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel\nannotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level\npreemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC\nutilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append\nproactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware\ndispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves\n4.6$\\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains\n1.6$\\times$-6.8$\\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to\nstate-of-the-art inference engines.",

      "summary": "We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning\nwithin a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and\nacquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.\nAt the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory\nsystem that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists\nof a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a\nspatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By\nintegrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves\nrelevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social\nrelationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent\nbeings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a\ndynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and\nare assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental\nresults show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents\nwell to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through\nobservation and social interaction.

While unstructured narratives\noffer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic\nanalysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable.

      "summary": "While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and\nuniversal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary\nplatforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and\nmarket leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode\ntheir user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this\nstatus quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and\ninteract with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability\ndramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal\ninteroperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data\nseamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines\nmonopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also\nlead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML\ncommunity should embrace this development while building the appropriate\nframeworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to\nrestore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.",

We\nshow that it is either optimal for the principal to provide a single full-range\ncontract, or the optimal low-type contract range excludes some high outputs, or\nthe optimal high-type contract range excludes some low outputs.

      "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of\nautonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,\nopen-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from\nstatic inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,\nwe systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different\nautonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,\nconstrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective\nreflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a\nunified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,\nand joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety\nacross the agent's decision-making loop.",

However, the independent development of voice and gesture\ngeneration technologies, alongside the growing popularity of virtual reality\n(VR), presents significant questions about the integration of these signals and\ntheir ability to convey emotional detail in immersive environments.
