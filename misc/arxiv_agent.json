      "title": "JoyAgents-R1: Joint Evolution Dynamics for Versatile Multi-LLM Agents\n  with Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm\nfor increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous\nagents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training\ninstability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal\nbenefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with\nmaximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve\ntraining stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter\nadjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution\nmechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to\neliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across\ngeneral and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves\nperformance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller\nopen-source models.",

      "summary": "Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased\ntheir powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,\ncurrent unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update\ncosts, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

      "title": "Curating art exhibitions using machine learning",
      "summary": "Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,\nwho, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of\nthose to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call\nart galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these\nartworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or\nconstructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a\ntotal of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset\nof artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions\nwhich have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar\ncuratorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions\nat the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data\navailable and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four\nartificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these\nvarious curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of\nprecision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key\ninsights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to\nconstruct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions\nwith an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature\nengineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can\nmake them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as\nGPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use\nthe models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it\nshould be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be\ncloser and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art\ncurators.",

      "title": "LLM-Based Social Simulations Require a Boundary",
      "summary": "This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social\nsimulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to\nsocial science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.",

      "summary": "Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution\ninformation obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The\nefficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the\ncurrent task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on\nreconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse\nreward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation\nmetrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we\npropose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task\nbelief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common\nfeatures of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification\nand exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief\nmetric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into\nthe specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task\ndistributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task\nfeatures, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation.

In this work, we first establish that guiding Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as\nsemantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval\neffectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,\nand SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive\nGeneration Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL\nframework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit\nShaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative\nlearning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new\nstate-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent\nbehavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary\nexploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without\nsacrificing performance.

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods\nhave been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing\nsurveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For\none thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such\nas 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other\nrelated tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most\nsurveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,\nwhile lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as\nmulti-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope\nto organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are\nreported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the\nbackground of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.\nA step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we\nalso investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open\nchallenges and future directions for MSFP.

We introduce\nAutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and\nrun machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in\nresearch papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase\nwith key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment.

Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new\nround of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs.\nInstead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as\nother agents and tools, to collectively perform more complex tasks. Under this\ntrend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future\nAI ecosystem, and many organizations intensively begin to design related\ncommunication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the\nrecent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazard,\nwhich can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers to\nquickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent\ncommunication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent\ncommunication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of\nagent communication and categorize the entire lifecyle of agent communication\ninto three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and\nagent-environment communication.

      "title": "How trust networks shape students' opinions about the proficiency of\n  artificially intelligent assistants",
      "summary": "The rising use of educational tools controlled by artificial intelligence\n(AI) has provoked a debate about their proficiency. While intrinsic\nproficiency, especially in tasks such as grading, has been measured and studied\nextensively, perceived proficiency remains underexplored. Here it is shown\nthrough Monte Carlo multi-agent simulations that trust networks among students\ninfluence their perceptions of the proficiency of an AI tool. A probabilistic\nopinion dynamics model is constructed, in which every student's perceptions are\ndescribed by a probability density function (PDF), which is updated at every\ntime step through independent, personal observations and peer pressure shaped\nby trust relationships. It is found that students infer correctly the AI tool's\nproficiency $\\theta_{\\rm AI}$ in allies-only networks (i.e.\\ high trust\nnetworks). AI-avoiders reach asymptotic learning faster than AI-users, and the\nasymptotic learning time for AI-users decreases as their number increases.\nHowever, asymptotic learning is disrupted even by a single partisan, who is\nstubbornly incorrect in their belief $\\theta_{\\rm p} \\neq \\theta_{\\rm AI}$,\nmaking other students' beliefs vacillate indefinitely between $\\theta_{\\rm p}$\nand $\\theta_{\\rm AI}$. In opponents-only (low trust) networks, all students\nreach asymptotic learning, but only a minority infer $\\theta_{\\rm AI}$\ncorrectly. AI-users have a small advantage over AI-avoiders in reaching the\nright conclusion. In mixed networks, students may exhibit turbulent\nnonconvergence and intermittency, or achieve asymptotic learning, depending on\nthe relationships between partisans and AI-users. The educational implications\nof the results are discussed briefly in the context of designing robust usage\npolicies for AI tools, with an emphasis on the unintended and inequitable\nconsequences which arise sometimes from counterintuitive network effects.",

To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile\neditor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from\nmultiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion\nmodels, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to\nmulti-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and\nhigh-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing\nmodel, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate\ngeometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also\nintroduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,\nleveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training\nand multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing\ncapabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D\nconsistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.",
