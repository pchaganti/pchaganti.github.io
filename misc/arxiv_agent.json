      "title": "Reinforcement Learning and Consumption-Savings Behavior",
      "summary": "This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling\nempirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns.\nI develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation\nto make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from\nstandard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key\nfindings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low\nliquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume\n(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs\n0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with\nGanong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment\nexperiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling\nfor current economic conditions, a \"scarring\" effect documented by Malmendier\nand Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about\nincome risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism\ngenerates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through\nvalue function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation\nresults closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive\nlearning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for\nunderstanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond\nwhat current economic conditions would predict.",

      "title": "Thought Communication in Multiagent Collaboration",
      "summary": "Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,\nambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.\nWhile machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent\nsystems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their\nembeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work\nilluminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges\nremain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of\ncompute or data scale.",

      "title": "Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via\n  Multi-Agent Systems",
      "summary": "We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum\ncodes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum\nLinear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis\nstrings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)\nequalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented\nwithin TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that\nsupports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow\nreasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,\nedit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.\nWithin this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates\nthe problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics\ninto rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and\nthe induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with\nnondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ and $n\\le6$ qubits,\nsystematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic\nlogical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$\nat $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring\nstructures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities\nfor all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue\ndegeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal\ncontrolled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts\ndiagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,\ncombining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It\nyields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger\n$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on static\ntrajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking\nthe real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To\nfacilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation\nbenchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object\ncategories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned\nknowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual\nnavigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path\nanti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns\nmulti-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure\nrepresentation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features\nwithin the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive\nsampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby\nreducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently\noutperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared\nto baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering\nmemory requirements.

      "summary": "Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward\nskill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class\nchallenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;\nothers to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which\ncandidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived\npost-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered\ntools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate\nstrategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;\neffort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on\nmerit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and\nderive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional\nselectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and\nutility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that\nquantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities\nwithout compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a\nperception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across\ngroups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,\npropagating disparities backward through otherwise \"fair\" selection processes.\nWhile the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle\nlinking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and\nstructural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments\nshape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.",

Recent models such as OpenAI-o3\nhave sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet\nextending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint\ntemporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce\nOpen-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal\nevidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design\ntraining strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model\nhighlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,\nallowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable\nthis functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,\nSTGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed\ntemporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either\ntemporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified\nspatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start\nreinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that\njointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.\nOn V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nraising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent\nimprovements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding\nbenchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench.

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors.",

Central to our framework\nis the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,\nwhich learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional\nrepresentations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure\nof the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles\nand key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for\nsuccessor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in\nthe zero-shot regime.

A Head Agent provides\nguidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands\nHSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table\nrow/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes\ncanonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional\nrefinement loop to resolve detected contradictions.
