      "title": "Embedding Autonomous Agents in Resource-Constrained Robotic Platforms",
      "summary": "Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.",

      "title": "Hierarchical GNN-Based Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane and Emergency Vehicle Corridor Formation",
      "summary": "Emergency vehicles require rapid passage through congested traffic, yet existing strategies fail to adapt to dynamic conditions. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.",

      "title": "Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents",
      "summary": "Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.",

      "title": "Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions",
      "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.",

      "title": "Wow, wo, val! A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test",
      "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.",

However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.",

      "summary": "Efficient navigation in swarms often relies on the emergence of decentralized approaches that minimize traversal time or energy. Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.",

      "summary": "The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.",

However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.",

      "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \\textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \\textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.",

      "title": "MobileDreamer: Generative Sketch World Model for GUI Agent",
      "summary": "Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.",

      "title": "HoneyTrap: Deceiving Large Language Model Attackers to Honeypot Traps with Resilient Multi-Agent Defense",
      "summary": "Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.",

Deciding where and why to run each of those applications is a complex task. Therefore, different approaches have been adopted to make offloading decisions. In this work, we propose a decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to address the selection of computing locations. Unlike most existing work, we analyze it in a real testbed composed of various edge devices running the agent to determine where to execute each task. These devices are connected to a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) server and a Cloud server through 5G communications. We evaluate not only the agent's performance in meeting task requirements but also the implications of running this type of agent locally, assessing the trade-offs of training locally versus remotely in terms of latency and energy consumption.",

      "title": "Current Agents Fail to Leverage World Model as Tool for Foresight",
      "summary": "Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.",

      "title": "Ensemble Models for Predicting Treatment Response in Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma Managed with Chemotherapy",
      "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for predicting chemotherapy response in pediatric brain tumors that are not amenable to complete surgical resection, using pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging combined with clinical information. Our method integrates a state-of-the-art pediatric brain tumor segmentation framework with radiomic feature extraction and clinical data through an ensemble of a Swin UNETR encoder and XGBoost classifier. The segmentation model delineates four tumor subregions enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, cystic component and edema which are used to extract imaging biomarkers and generate predictive features. The Swin UNETR network classifies the response to treatment directly from these segmented MRI scans, while XGBoost predicts response using radiomics and clinical variables including legal sex, ethnicity, race, age at event (in days), molecular subtype, tumor locations, initial surgery status, metastatic status, metastasis location, chemotherapy type, protocol name and chemotherapy agents. The ensemble output provides a non-invasive estimate of chemotherapy response in this historically challenging population characterized by lower progression-free survival. Among compared approaches, our Swin-Ensemble achieved the best performance (precision for non effective cases=0.68, recall for non effective cases=0.85, precision for chemotherapy effective cases=0.64 and overall accuracy=0.69), outperforming Mamba-FeatureFuse, Swin UNETR encoder, and Swin-FeatureFuse models. Our findings suggest that this ensemble framework represents a promising step toward personalized therapy response prediction for pediatric low-grade glioma patients in need of chemotherapy treatment who are not suitable for complete surgical resection, a population with significantly lower progression free survival and for whom chemotherapy remains the primary treatment option.",

While bigraphs theoretically support the identification of bisimilar agents, by simulating and comparing their corresponding minimal contextual transition systems, no known algorithm exists for computing the maximum shared structure between two bigraphs, an essential prerequisite for determining the set of possible transitions for a given agent state. In this work, we provide a definition of the maximum common bigraph problem, and present an adaptation of the McSplit maximum common induced subgraph algorithm to compute the maximum common bigraph between two bigraph states. Our approach opens a path toward supporting bisimulation checking in bigraph-based tools, which have been leveraged in other modelling paradigms for simplification, optimisation, and verification of models.",

      "title": "Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning for 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Annotations",
      "summary": "Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\\% in both Dice and IoU scores.",

However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \\textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \\textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks.

This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication.
