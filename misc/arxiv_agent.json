      "title": "Affogato: Learning Open-Vocabulary Affordance Grounding with Automated\n  Data Generation at Scale",
      "summary": "Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language\ndescriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent\nagents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task\nremains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,\nthe ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity\nof large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale\nbenchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text\ndescriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of\nobjects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet\neffective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision\nbackbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the\nAffogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D\nbenchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain\ngeneralization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/project-affogato/affogato",
