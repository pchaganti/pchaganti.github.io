By\nconditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy\nof the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the\nenvironment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive\nconditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of\nreal-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a\nhierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling\na comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control\nabilities.

      "summary": "With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological\ncounseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of\nmental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue\nsafety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address\nthese issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological\ncounseling large language model agent developed based on the base model\nInternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation\ndata fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the\nmodel's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe\ndialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom\nworkflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed\nto introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological\ncounseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to\nstrengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the\nbaseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological\ncounseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation\n(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism\n(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\\%) and dialogue safety (\\safe{} score\nimprovement of 2.4\\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology\n(GGUF q4\\_k\\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient\nfor operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling\napplications in resource-constrained environments.",

      "summary": "Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models\nautonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive\ncitation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with\nweb-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive\noffloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have\noutpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume\nshort search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web\n2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that\nrequire real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed\nwith over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating\ntime-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge\nframework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a\ntree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness\nand source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier\nagentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error\nanalysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,\nOpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while\nspending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2\nprovides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next\ngeneration of agentic search systems.",

For integer $d \\ge 2$, a\n$d$-multi-allocation is an allocation in which each item is allocated to at\nmost $d$ different agents. We show that $d$-multi-allocations can be\ntransformed into allocations, while not losing much more than a factor of $d$\nin the value that each agent receives.

Hanabi is\na cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained\ncommunication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it\nan ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI\ninteraction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this\nwork, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to\novercome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human\nevaluations.

      "summary": "Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult,\nparticularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in\nquantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of\nthe system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary\ntransformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter\nestimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL),\nspecifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum\noptimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system\nfor the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a\nbackground magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective\nmeasurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by\napplying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL\nagent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a\ntransverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to\nexisting sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against\nvarious Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to\ninvestigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find\nthat the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as\nthe pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to\ngeneralize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.",

A promising approach is to\nuse reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select\nreward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench\ntargeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,\na benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The\nbenchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and\nreal-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and\nsafety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the\nassessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a\nmore granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)\nAppropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse\nmodels, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification\nto ensure the integrity of the data.

This\nremains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily\nshaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),\na motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with\npotentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's\ngradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the\njoint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several\nhundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This\nenables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the\nintegration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.\nConsequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing\nsafety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles\ndemonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet\nplanner, and vanilla MPPI.",

This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral\nroll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the\nmel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an\naudio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)\nsystem. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains\nsubtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,\nthese additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.\nSecond, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs\nprocessed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the\nfinal class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.\nFinally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy\nof low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating\nexternal data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of\ndata points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could\ndegrade model performance.

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,\nsuch as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are\nvulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation\nspace. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade\nvalue estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the\nexisting policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the\npractical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for\nsecure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat\nscenarios.",

Data selection has shown promise to mitigate\nredundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing\ntraining costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically\nrely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined\neffect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We\nintroduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample\nredundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic\nstructure of the dataset.
