      "title": "ReSum: Unlocking Long-Horizon Search Intelligence via Context\n  Summarization",
      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on\nknowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in\nparadigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing\ninteraction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of\nprior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a\nReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on\nBrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web\nagents.",

      "title": "WebWeaver: Structuring Web-Scale Evidence with Dynamic Outlines for\n  Open-Ended Deep Research",
      "summary": "This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where\nAI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.\nCurrent approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research\npipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot\ngeneration paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like\n\"loss in the middle\" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively\ninterleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a\ncomprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.\nThe writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,\ncomposing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art\nacross major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and\nDeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative\nmethodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are\ncrucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.",

      "title": "Towards General Agentic Intelligence via Environment Scaling",
      "summary": "Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language\nModels in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand\nprecise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop\nthese capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of\nfunction-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in\nwhich agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step\ntowards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central\nchallenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how\nto effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through\ninteractions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable\nframework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are\nfully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling\nscenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first\nendowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them\nfor domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,\ntau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,\nAgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.",

We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic\nfoundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn\ndiverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby\ncreating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to\npropose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the\ndeep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational\nmodels. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named\nAgentFounder.

In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for\nbuilding such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an\niterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov\nDecision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving\nreports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context\nsuffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual\napproaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that\ngenerates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity\nescalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap\nbetween passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction.

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated\nsuperhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks\nsuch as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable.

      "title": "Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling",
      "summary": "Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational\ncognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are\nremembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and\nprocedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real\nlife the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing\npatterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally\nminimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes\nare treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,\nasking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,\nsituational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not\nvague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,\nmodeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging\nphenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such\nspecificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical\naims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and\nworthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA\nexample of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied\nmore broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.",

      "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial\nattacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness.",

      "title": "Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World\n  Interview Data",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring\nnuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,\ncounselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret\nhuman personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains\nunexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While\nprior work has simulated LLM \"personas\" using discrete Big Five labels on\nsocial media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth\npersonality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely\nunexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising\nsemi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five\ntrait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance\nacross three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with\nGPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA\narchitectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT\nand OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson\ncorrelations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits\nremain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with\nvalidated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal\ngains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on\nlatent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings\nunderscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and\nmotivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and\nalignment-oriented fine-tuning.",

However, existing combinatorial assignment\nmechanisms (for applications such as course allocation, food banks, and refugee\nresettlement) guarantee these properties either ex ante or ex post, but not\nboth. We propose a new class of mechanisms based on Competitive Equilibrium\nfrom Random Incomes (CERI): Agents receive random token budgets and select\noptimal lotteries at competitive prices that clear markets in expectation. Our\nmain insight is to let the CERI price vector guide all ex-post allocations. We\nshow that all ordinally efficient allocations are CERI allocations, which can\nbe implemented as lotteries over near-feasible Pareto-efficient outcomes. With\nidentical budget distributions, CERI allocations are ordinally envy-free; with\nbudget distributions on small supports, ex-post allocations are envy-free up to\none good.

      "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the\ndevelopment of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents\nthat can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon\nenvironments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to\ninteract with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,\nand (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to\nstimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable\nactions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate\nhigh-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning\nframework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon\nenvironments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill\nlibrary containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill\nplanner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized\nskills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a\nlong-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and\nchallenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PLAP.
