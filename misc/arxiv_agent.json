      "title": "LLMs can Compress LLMs: Adaptive Pruning by Agents",
      "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.",

      "summary": "Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.",

      "title": "Automating Supply Chain Disruption Monitoring via an Agentic AI Approach",
      "summary": "Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.",

      "title": "Collaborative Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning",
      "summary": "Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.",

The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. A large class of admissible policies is identified over which the agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, consisting of a running reward and income from either discrete impulses or singular actions. The long-term expected total reward and its relation to overtaking optimality is also considered. Sensitivity analysis with regard to the parameters of the impulse control model are performed. Key connections between the impulse and singular control problems are displayed.",

      "summary": "While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.",

      "title": "LLM for Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: A Lightweight Few-Shot Learning Approach",
      "summary": "Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

      "title": "LLMs Got Rhythm? Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant \"Reasoning Gap\": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\\%. We release our system and a crucial, rigorously cleaned corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.",

      "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as \"prompt injection\" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \\textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.",

      "title": "Private LLM Inference on Consumer Blackwell GPUs: A Practical Guide for Cost-Effective Local Deployment in SMEs",
      "summary": "SMEs increasingly seek alternatives to cloud LLM APIs, which raise data privacy concerns. Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), which is 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs, with hardware breaking even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day). Our results show that consumer GPUs can reliably replace cloud inference for most SME workloads, except latency-critical long-context RAG, where high-end GPUs remain essential. We provide deployment guidance and release all benchmark data for reproducible SME-scale deployments.",

      "summary": "Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.",

Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.",

      "summary": "While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.",

      "summary": "Judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards poses a core challenge for computational legal analysis. Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.",

      "title": "MAD: Motion Appearance Decoupling for efficient Driving World Models",
      "summary": "Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

      "title": "DepRadar: Agentic Coordination for Context Aware Defect Impact Analysis in Deep Learning Libraries",
      "summary": "Deep learning libraries like Transformers and Megatron are now widely adopted in modern AI programs. However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.",

      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enhance complex problem solving through multi-agent collaboration, but often incur substantially higher costs than single-agent systems. Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.",

Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets.

While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \\texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \\texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.",

However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems.
