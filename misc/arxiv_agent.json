      "title": "SARAH: Spatially Aware Real-time Agentic Humans",
      "summary": "As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details.",

      "title": "SMaRT: Online Reusable Resource Assignment and an Application to Mediation in the Kenyan Judiciary",
      "summary": "Motivated by the problem of assigning mediators to cases in the Kenyan judicial, we study an online resource allocation problem where incoming tasks (cases) must be immediately assigned to available, capacity-constrained resources (mediators). The resources differ in their quality, which may need to be learned. In addition, resources can only be assigned to a subset of tasks that overlaps to varying degrees with the subset of tasks other resources can be assigned to. The objective is to maximize task completion while satisfying soft capacity constraints across all the resources. The scale of the real-world problem poses substantial challenges, since there are over 2000 mediators and a multitude of combinations of geographic locations (87) and case types (12) that each mediator is qualified to work on. Together, these features, unknown quality of new resources, soft capacity constraints, and a high-dimensional state space, make existing scheduling and resource allocation algorithms either inapplicable or inefficient. We formalize the problem in a tractable manner using a quadratic program formulation for assignment and a multi-agent bandit-style framework for learning. We demonstrate the key properties and advantages of our new algorithm, SMaRT (Selecting Mediators that are Right for the Task), compared with baselines on stylized instances of the mediator allocation problem. We then consider its application to real-world data on cases and mediators from the Kenyan judiciary. SMaRT outperforms baselines and allows control over the tradeoff between the strictness of capacity constraints and overall case resolution rates, both in settings where mediator quality is known beforehand and in bandit-like settings where learning is part of the problem definition. On the strength of these results, we plan to run a randomized controlled trial with SMaRT in the judiciary in the near future.",

      "summary": "Comprehensively retrieving diverse documents is crucial to address queries that admit a wide range of valid answers. We introduce retrieve-verify-retrieve (RVR), a multi-round retrieval framework designed to maximize answer coverage. Initially, a retriever takes the original query and returns a candidate document set, followed by a verifier that identifies a high-quality subset. For subsequent rounds, the query is augmented with previously verified documents to uncover answers that are not yet covered in previous rounds. RVR is effective even with off-the-shelf retrievers, and fine-tuning retrievers for our inference procedure brings further gains. Our method outperforms baselines, including agentic search approaches, achieving at least 10% relative and 3% absolute gain in complete recall percentage on a multi-answer retrieval dataset (QAMPARI). We also see consistent gains on two out-of-domain datasets (QUEST and WebQuestionsSP) across different base retrievers. Our work presents a promising iterative approach for comprehensive answer recall leveraging a verifier and adapting retrievers to a new inference scenario.",

      "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), offering new possibilities for navigation decision-making that could benefit both robotic platforms and human users. However, real-world navigation is inherently conditioned by the agent's mobility constraints. For example, a sweeping robot cannot traverse stairs, while a quadruped can. We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities. We evaluate 13 modern VLMs and find that current VLM's navigation performance drops sharply as mobility constraints tighten, and that even state-of-the-art models struggle with obstacle types that require reasoning on spatial dimensions. We conclude by discussing the implications for capability-aware navigation and the opportunities for advancing embodied spatial reasoning in future VLMs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/makeabilitylab/CapNav",

      "summary": "With the rapid improvement of LLMs' coding capabilities, the bottleneck of LLM-based automated software development is shifting from generating correct code to eliciting users' requirements. Despite growing interest, the interview competence of LLMs in conversational requirements elicitation remains fully underexplored. Existing evaluations often depend on a few scenarios, real user interaction, and subjective human scoring, which hinders systematic and quantitative comparison. To address these challenges, we propose ReqElicitGym, an interactive and automatic evaluation environment for assessing interview competence in conversational requirements elicitation. Specifically, ReqElicitGym introduces a new evaluation dataset and designs both an interactive oracle user and a task evaluator. The dataset contains 101 website requirements elicitation scenarios spanning 10 application types. Both the oracle user and the task evaluator achieve high agreement with real users and expert judgment. Using our ReqElicitGym, any automated conversational requirements elicitation approach (e.g., LLM-based agents) can be evaluated in a reproducible and quantitative manner through interaction with the environment. Based on our ReqElicitGym, we conduct a systematic empirical study on seven representative LLMs, and the results show that current LLMs still exhibit limited interview competence in uncovering implicit requirements. Particularly, they elicit less than half of the users' implicit requirements, and their effective elicitation questions often emerge in later turns of the dialogue. Besides, we found LLMs can elicit interaction and content implicit requirements, but consistently struggle with style-related requirements. We believe ReqElicitGym will facilitate the evaluation and development of automated conversational requirements elicitation.",

      "title": "Diffusing to Coordinate: Efficient Online Multi-Agent Diffusion Policies",
      "summary": "Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \\underline{O}nline off-policy \\underline{MA}RL framework using \\underline{D}iffusion policies (\\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\\times$ to $5\\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.",

      "title": "Efficient Calculation of Absorption Spectra of Platinum Complexes Used as Luminescent Probes for Cancer Detection",
      "summary": "Despite major advances in oncology, many chemotherapeutic agents still cause severe side effects that reduce quality of life, motivating new approaches for early detection and targeted elimination of cancer cells. Luminescent transition metal complexes are promising biomolecular probes, since intercalation between DNA base pairs significantly changes their luminescence. However, reliable computational protocols to predict optical properties of transition metal intercalators are limited, making accurate absorption spectra calculations essential for screening candidates. Here, we benchmark methods for computing UV-Vis spectra of a Pt(II) pincer complex. The complex is studied both in isolation and intercalated in a small DNA model, representing probes designed to target DNA-associated molecular abnormalities. We find that the largest source of uncertainty stems from the exchange-correlation functional and recommend range-separated hybrids for robust spectral predictions. The Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the resolution of identity (RI) approximations provide significant speedups for TD-DFT with only a modest loss of accuracy. Since geometry optimization is often the dominant cost, PBEh-3c emerges as an efficient alternative to conventional DFT, introducing errors comparable to those from TDA. Tight-binding methods (GFN-xTB) offer further acceleration, but yield larger deviations in structures and UV-Vis spectra; thus, unless extensive optimization is required, PBEh-3c provides the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.",

      "title": "PRISM: Parallel Reward Integration with Symmetry for MORL",
      "summary": "This work studies heterogeneous Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), where objectives can differ sharply in temporal frequency. Such heterogeneity allows dense objectives to dominate learning, while sparse long-horizon rewards receive weak credit assignment, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose a Parallel Reward Integration with Symmetry (PRISM) algorithm that enforces reflectional symmetry as an inductive bias in aligning reward channels. PRISM introduces ReSymNet, a theory-motivated model that reconciles temporal-frequency mismatches across objectives, using residual blocks to learn a scaled opportunity value that accelerates exploration while preserving the optimal policy. We also propose SymReg, a reflectional equivariance regulariser that enforces agent mirroring and constrains policy search to a reflection-equivariant subspace. This restriction provably reduces hypothesis complexity and improves generalisation. Across MuJoCo benchmarks, PRISM consistently outperforms both a sparse-reward baseline and an oracle trained with full dense rewards, improving Pareto coverage and distributional balance: it achieves hypervolume gains exceeding 100\\% over the baseline and up to 32\\% over the oracle.

      "title": "A Probabilistic Framework for LLM-Based Model Discovery",
      "summary": "Automated methods for discovering mechanistic simulator models from observational data offer a promising path toward accelerating scientific progress. Such methods often take the form of agentic-style iterative workflows that repeatedly propose and revise candidate models by imitating human discovery processes. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically implement such workflows via hand-crafted heuristic procedures, without an explicit probabilistic formulation. We recast model discovery as probabilistic inference, i.e., as sampling from an unknown distribution over mechanistic models capable of explaining the data. This perspective provides a unified way to reason about model proposal, refinement, and selection within a single inference framework. As a concrete instantiation of this view, we introduce ModelSMC, an algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling. ModelSMC represents candidate models as particles which are iteratively proposed and refined by an LLM, and weighted using likelihood-based criteria. Experiments on real-world scientific systems illustrate that this formulation discovers models with interpretable mechanisms and improves posterior predictive checks. More broadly, this perspective provides a probabilistic lens for understanding and developing LLM-based approaches to model discovery.",

      "summary": "This paper presents a role-adaptive Leader-Follower-based formation planning and control framework for teams of quadruped robots operating in cluttered environments. Unlike conventional methods with fixed leaders or rigid formation roles, the proposed approach integrates dynamic role assignment and partial goal planning, enabling flexible, collision-free navigation in complex scenarios. Formation stability and inter-robot safety are ensured through a virtual spring-damper system coupled with a novel obstacle avoidance layer that adaptively adjusts each agent's velocity. A dynamic look-ahead reference generator further enhances flexibility, allowing temporary formation deformation to maneuver around obstacles while maintaining goal-directed motion. The Fast Marching Square (FM2) algorithm provides the global path for the leader and local paths for the followers as the planning backbone. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with teams of quadruped robots. Results demonstrate smooth coordination, adaptive role switching, and robust formation maintenance in complex, unstructured environments.

Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users.

      "summary": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions serve as gateways into offensive cybersecurity, yet they often present steep barriers for novices due to complex toolchains and opaque workflows. Recently, agentic AI frameworks for cybersecurity promise to lower these barriers by automating and coordinating penetration testing tasks. However, their role in shaping novice learning remains underexplored.\n  We present a human-centered, mixed-methods case study examining how agentic AI frameworks -- here Cybersecurity AI (CAI) -- mediates novice entry into CTF-based penetration testing. An undergraduate student without prior hacking experience attempted to approach performance benchmarks from a national cybersecurity challenge using CAI. Quantitative performance metrics were complemented by structured reflective analysis of learning progression and AI interaction patterns.\n  Our thematic analysis suggest that agentic AI reduces initial entry barriers by providing overview, structure and guidance, thereby lowering the cognitive workload during early engagement. Quantitatively, the observed extensive exploration of strategies and low per-strategy execution time potetially facilitatates cybersecurity training on meta, i.e. strategic levels. At the same time, AI-assisted cybersecurity education introduces new challenges related to trust, dependency, and responsible use.

The InnoRegioChallenge project investigated whether a virtual test and integration environment can reproduce electronic control unit (ECU) behavior early enough to run real software binaries before physical hardware exists. We report a prototype that generates instruction-accurate processor models in SystemC/TLM~2.0 using an agentic, feedback-driven workflow coupled to a reference simulator via the GNU Debugger (GDB). The results indicate that the most critical technical risk -- CPU behavioral fidelity -- can be reduced through automated differential testing and iterative model correction. We summarize the architecture, the agentic modeling loop, and project outcomes, and we extrapolate plausible technical details consistent with the reported qualitative findings. While cloud-scale deployment and full toolchain integration remain future work, the prototype demonstrates a viable shift-left path for virtual ECU twins, enabling reproducible tests, non-intrusive tracing, and fault-injection campaigns aligned with safety standards.",

      "title": "Agentic Adversarial QA for Improving Domain-Specific LLMs",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite extensive pretraining on broad internet corpora, often struggle to adapt effectively to specialized domains. There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps. Evaluation on specialized subsets of the LegalBench corpus demonstrates that our method achieves greater accuracy with substantially fewer synthetic samples.",

      "title": "Dynamic Deception: When Pedestrians Team Up to Fool Autonomous Cars",
      "summary": "Many adversarial attacks on autonomous-driving perception models fail to cause system-level failures once deployed in a full driving stack. The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety.",

      "title": "3DMedAgent: Unified Perception-to-Understanding for 3D Medical Analysis",
      "summary": "3D CT analysis spans a continuum from low-level perception to high-level clinical understanding. Existing 3D-oriented analysis methods adopt either isolated task-specific modeling or task-agnostic end-to-end paradigms to produce one-hop outputs, impeding the systematic accumulation of perceptual evidence for downstream reasoning. In parallel, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit improved visual perception and can integrate visual and textual information effectively, yet their predominantly 2D-oriented designs fundamentally limit their ability to perceive and analyze volumetric medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose 3DMedAgent, a unified agent that enables 2D MLLMs to perform general 3D CT analysis without 3D-specific fine-tuning. 3DMedAgent coordinates heterogeneous visual and textual tools through a flexible MLLM agent, progressively decomposing complex 3D analysis into tractable subtasks that transition from global to regional views, from 3D volumes to informative 2D slices, and from visual evidence to structured textual representations. Central to this design, 3DMedAgent maintains a long-term structured memory that aggregates intermediate tool outputs and supports query-adaptive, evidence-driven multi-step reasoning. We further introduce the DeepChestVQA benchmark for evaluating unified perception-to-understanding capabilities in 3D thoracic imaging. Experiments across over 40 tasks demonstrate that 3DMedAgent consistently outperforms general, medical, and 3D-specific MLLMs, highlighting a scalable path toward general-purpose 3D clinical assistants.Code and data are available at \\href{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}.",

      "summary": "Evaluation is no longer a final checkpoint in the machine learning lifecycle. As AI systems evolve from static models to compound, tool-using agents, evaluation becomes a core control function. The question is no longer \"How good is the model?\" but \"Can we trust the system to behave as intended, under change, at scale?\". Yet most evaluation practices remain anchored in assumptions inherited from the model-centric era: static benchmarks, aggregate scores, and one-off success criteria. This paper argues that such approaches are increasingly obscure rather than illuminating system behavior. We examine how evaluation pipelines themselves introduce silent failure modes, why high benchmark scores routinely mislead teams, and how agentic systems fundamentally alter the meaning of performance measurement. Rather than proposing new metrics or harder benchmarks, we aim to clarify the role of evaluation in the AI era, and especially for agents: not as performance theater, but as a measurement discipline that conditions trust, iteration, and governance in non-deterministic systems.",

      "summary": "Mean-field reinforcement learning (MF-RL) scales multi-agent RL to large populations by reducing each agent's dependence on others to a single summary statistic -- the mean action. However, this reduction requires every agent to act at every time step; when some agents are idle, the mean action is simply undefined. Addressing asynchrony therefore requires a different summary statistic -- one that remains defined regardless of which agents act. The population distribution $μ\\in Δ(\\mathcal{O})$ -- the fraction of agents at each observation -- satisfies this requirement: its dimension is independent of $N$, and under exchangeability it fully determines each agent's reward and transition. Existing MF-RL theory, however, is built on the mean action and does not extend to $μ$. We therefore construct the Temporal Mean Field (TMF) framework around the population distribution $μ$ from scratch, covering the full spectrum from fully synchronous to purely sequential decision-making within a single theory. We prove existence and uniqueness of TMF equilibria, establish an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ finite-population approximation bound that holds regardless of how many agents act per step, and prove convergence of a policy gradient algorithm (TMF-PG) to the unique equilibrium. Experiments on a resource selection game and a dynamic queueing game confirm that TMF-PG achieves near-identical performance whether one agent or all $N$ act per step, with approximation error decaying at the predicted $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ rate.",
