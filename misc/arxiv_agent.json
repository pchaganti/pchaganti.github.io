      "title": "The Adoption and Usage of AI Agents: Early Evidence from Perplexity",
      "summary": "This paper presents the first large-scale field study of the adoption, usage intensity, and use cases of general-purpose AI agents operating in open-world web environments. Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities.",

      "title": "An Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture for Threat Behavior Analysis via Deep Learning",
      "summary": "The escalating sophistication and variety of cyber threats have rendered static honeypots inadequate, necessitating adaptive, intelligence-driven deception. In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence.",

      "title": "WorldReel: 4D Video Generation with Consistent Geometry and Motion Modeling",
      "summary": "Recent video generators achieve striking photorealism, yet remain fundamentally inconsistent in 3D. We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.",

      "title": "Efficient and Compliant Control Framework for Versatile Human-Humanoid Collaborative Transportation",
      "summary": "We present a control framework that enables humanoid robots to perform collaborative transportation tasks with a human partner. The framework supports both translational and rotational motions, which are fundamental to co-transport scenarios. It comprises three components: a high-level planner, a low-level controller, and a stiffness modulation mechanism. At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans. These are executed by a QP-based whole-body controller that accounts for the coupled humanoid-object dynamics. Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass. We validate the effectiveness of the framework through real-world experiments conducted on the Digit humanoid platform. To quantify collaboration quality, we propose an efficiency metric that captures both task performance and inter-agent coordination. We show that this metric highlights the role of compliance in collaborative tasks and offers insights into desirable trajectory characteristics across both high- and low-level control layers. Finally, we showcase experimental results on collaborative behaviors, including translation, turning, and combined motions such as semi circular trajectories, representative of naturally occurring co-transportation tasks.",

      "title": "Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support",
      "summary": "LLM-based agents are rapidly being plugged into expert decision-support, yet in messy, high-stakes settings they rarely make the team smarter: human-AI teams often underperform the best individual, experts oscillate between verification loops and over-reliance, and the promised complementarity does not materialise. We argue this is not just a matter of accuracy, but a fundamental gap in how we conceive AI assistance: expert decisions are made through collaborative cognitive processes where mental models, goals, and constraints are continually co-constructed, tested, and revised between human and AI. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can reframe MAS research around agents that participate in collaborative sensemaking and act as AI teammates that think with their human partners.",

      "title": "Automating High Energy Physics Data Analysis with LLM-Powered Agents",
      "summary": "We present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the use of large language model (LLM) agents to automate a representative high energy physics (HEP) analysis. Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager. In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings. Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results. This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments. The baseline code used in this work is available at https://huggingface.co/HWresearch/LLM4HEP.

      "summary": "We present an efficient algorithm to compute the explicit open-loop solution to both finite and infinite-horizon dynamic games subject to state and input constraints. Our approach relies on a multiparametric affine variational inequality characterization of the open-loop Nash equilibria and extends the classical explicit constrained LQR and MPC frameworks to multi-agent non-cooperative settings. A key practical implication is that linear-quadratic game-theoretic MPC becomes viable even at very high sampling rates for multi-agent systems of moderate size. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvements in online computation time and solution accuracy compared with state-of-the-art game-theoretic solvers.",

      "title": "Privacy Practices of Browser Agents",
      "summary": "This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the privacy behaviors and attributes of eight recent, popular browser agents. Browser agents are software that automate Web browsing using large language models and ancillary tooling. However, the automated capabilities that make browser agents powerful also make them high-risk points of failure. Both the kinds of tasks browser agents are designed to execute, along with the kinds of information browser agents are entrusted with to fulfill those tasks, mean that vulnerabilities in these tools can result in enormous privacy harm.\n  This work presents a framework of five broad factors (totaling 15 distinct measurements) to measure the privacy risks in browser agents. Our framework assesses i. vulnerabilities in the browser agent's components, ii. how the browser agent protects against website behaviors, iii. whether the browser agent prevents cross-site tracking, iv. how the agent responds to privacy-affecting prompts, and v. whether the tool leaks personal information to sites. We apply our framework to eight browser agents and identify 30 vulnerabilities, ranging from disabled browser privacy features to \"autocompleting\" sensitive personal information in form fields. We have responsibly disclosed our findings, and plan to release our dataset and other artifacts.",

      "summary": "As AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in society, issues of coordination, control, delegation, and accountability are entangled with concerns over their reliability. To design and implement LLM agents around reliable operations, we should consider the task complexity in the application settings and reduce their limitations while striving to minimize agent failures and optimize resource efficiency. High-functioning human organizations have faced similar balancing issues, which led to evidence-based theories that seek to understand their functioning strategies. We examine the parallels between LLM agents and the compatible frameworks in organization science, focusing on what the design, scaling, and management of organizations can inform agentic systems towards improving reliability. We offer three preliminary accounts of organizational principles for AI agent engineering to attain reliability and effectiveness, through balancing agency and capabilities in agent design, resource constraints and performance benefits in agent scaling, and internal and external mechanisms in agent management. Our work extends the growing exchanges between the operational and governance principles of AI systems and social systems to facilitate system integration.",

      "title": "Optimization-Guided Diffusion for Interactive Scene Generation",
      "summary": "Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.",

      "title": "The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds",
      "summary": "When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\\Ceff = (\\Itotal/\\Istep), \\Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\",

      "title": "Online Segment Any 3D Thing as Instance Tracking",
      "summary": "Online, real-time, and fine-grained 3D segmentation constitutes a fundamental capability for embodied intelligent agents to perceive and comprehend their operational environments. Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing ESAM by 2.8 AP on ScanNet200 and delivering consistent gains on ScanNet, SceneNN, and 3RScan datasets.",

      "title": "Understanding Individual Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Dynamical Systems Approach",
      "summary": "Analysing learning behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments is challenging, in particular with respect to \\textit{individual} decision-making. Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \\textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes.",

      "title": "See Once, Then Act: Vision-Language-Action Model with Task Learning from One-Shot Video Demonstrations",
      "summary": "Developing robust and general-purpose manipulation policies represents a fundamental objective in robotics research. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos. Real-world experiments demonstrate effective learning from human videos, yielding more than 38% improvement on unseen tasks.",

      "title": "VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection",
      "summary": "We propose VulnLLM-R, the~\\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

      "title": "The Suicide Region: Option Games and the Race to Artificial General Intelligence",
      "summary": "Standard real options theory predicts delay in exercising the option to invest or deploy when extreme asset volatility or technological uncertainty are present. However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a \"suicide region\" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that \"warning shots\" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment.",

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum.

In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\\% success rate of the SOTA approach.",

      "summary": "We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) can iteratively plan, call external tools, and integrate returned information to solve complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.",
