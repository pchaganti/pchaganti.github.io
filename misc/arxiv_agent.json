      "summary": "Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios\nrequires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic\nnature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely\non rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.\nWe present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework\nthat enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world\nInternet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search\ntools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by\nan outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect\na multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers\ndiverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset\nwith both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for\nshaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on\nknowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only\noutperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the\nperformance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over\n30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for\nadvancing research in multimodal search.",

      "title": "The Decrypto Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reasoning and Theory of Mind",
      "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to\nnavigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other\nagents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning\nskills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason\nabout the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that\nDecrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and\npaves the path towards better artificial agents.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when\nreasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question\nanswering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy\nthat first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically\nconstructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts\ntogether to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we\ncall Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across\ndiverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the\nperformance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in\ncontext. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento\nimproves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the\nmulti-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points.

      "summary": "Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong\ncapabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents\nin high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.\nUnethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world\nconsequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer\nthe ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model\nediting task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area\nof research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while\npreserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate\nthis approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in\npsychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and\nediting of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier\nintroducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that\nBehavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within\nspecific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only\nscenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an\nagent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be\nused to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce\nharmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents\nbased on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior\nEditing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights\ninto a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise\nand perils of Behavior Editing.",

In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein\nproduction research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based\nLLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific\nliterature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,\nand (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to\nextract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel\nmethodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent\noptimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the\nperformance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based\ncosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine\nsimilarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean\nscores of $\\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved\nthe mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\\geq 0.94$) compared to\nprompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with\nthe latter approach.

Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect\nsomething essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to\nencode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to\noccur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric\n(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete\nterms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current\ntechnology.

In most OD\nmodels, opinions evolve as a consequence of interactions between agents, and\nthe opinion fusion rule defines how those opinions are updated. In consequence,\ndespite being simplistic, OD models provide an explainable and interpretable\nmechanism for understanding the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution.\nUnfortunately, existing OD models mainly focus on explaining the evolution of\n(usually synthetic) opinions towards consensus, fragmentation, or polarization,\nbut they usually fail to analyze scenarios of (real-world) highly oscillating\nopinions. This work overcomes this limitation by studying the ability of\nseveral OD models to reproduce highly oscillating dynamics. To this end, we\nformulate an optimization problem which is further solved using Evolutionary\nAlgorithms, providing both quantitative results on the performance of the\noptimization and qualitative interpretations on the obtained results. Our\nexperiments on a real-world opinion dataset about immigration from the monthly\nbarometer of the Spanish Sociological Research Center show that the ATBCR,\nbased on both rational and emotional mechanisms of opinion update, is the most\naccurate OD model for capturing highly oscillating opinions.",

This is largely\ndue to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited\nfamiliarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce\nDeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large\nlanguage model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The\nsystem generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each\naccompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate\nanalytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term\nmemory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific\nanalytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,\nup-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current\nclinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases.

The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable\ncapabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced\nreasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond\nmonolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent\nsystems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more\neffectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel\nmulti-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security\nverification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification\nquestion answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan\nand property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug\nvalidation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in\nthese diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as\nin-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

      "summary": "Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only\nunderstand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their\naction outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement\nlearning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing\nresearch centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online\noptimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic\ninteraction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into\nlocal optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action\ncorrection. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called\nMobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with\ntask-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three\nstages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level\nreward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn\ntrajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error\ncorrection capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance\nimprovements.

State-of-the art planners can efficiently\nresolve the next, imminent interaction cooperatively and do not focus on longer\nplanning horizons. This makes it hard to maneuver scenarios where the agent\nneeds to select a good strategy to find gaps or channels in the crowd. We\npropose to decompose trajectory planning into two separate steps: Conflict\navoidance for finding good, macroscopic trajectories, and cooperative collision\navoidance (CCA) for resolving the next interaction optimally. We propose the\nProbabilistic Gap Planner (PGP) as a conflict avoidance planner. PGP modifies\nan established probabilistic collision risk model to include a general\nassumption of cooperativity. PGP biases the short-term CCA planner to head\ntowards gaps in the crowd. In extensive simulations with crowds of varying\ndensity, we show that using PGP in addition to state-of-the-art CCA planners\nimproves the agents' performance: On average, agents keep more space to others,\ncreate less tension, and cause fewer collisions.

      "summary": "The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing\ncritical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries\nthat render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to\naddress a foundational \"Trinity of Trust,\" comprising the fidelity of the\nsystem model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the\nanalytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC\nframework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,\nclosed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based \"Blue Agent\" defender is\ncontinuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats\ndiscovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to\nbecome progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously\nprobe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the\nTEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A\ncomprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including\nROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is\nresponsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.\nBy integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC\narchitecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a\nnecessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future\nof critical infrastructure.",
