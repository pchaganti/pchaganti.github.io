      "title": "Towards Generalizable Safety in Crowd Navigation via Conformal\n  Uncertainty Handling",
      "summary": "Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are\nknown to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

      "title": "Simulating Human-Like Learning Dynamics with LLM-Empowered Agents",
      "summary": "Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a\nmajor research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior.",

      "title": "The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience",
      "summary": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.",

      "title": "Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for GUI Grounding via Region\n  Consistency",
      "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural\nlanguage instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to\nautonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance\nthrough extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled\nrewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level\nannotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the\nsame GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence\nsignals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we\npropose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs\nspatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus\nregions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC\nimproves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot\nbenchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy\nOptimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for\ntest-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns\nwith the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine\ntheir outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts\nQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO\nfurther improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization.

      "summary": "Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for\nembodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a\ncomprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about\nphysical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied\ntasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit\ncollaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire\ncapabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task\ndemands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically\n(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing\nfundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied\nreasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can\naddress, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and\nadvancing embodied AI systems.

      "summary": "Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the\ngenerated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on\nimage-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their\nability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity\nlocal details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a\nhierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It\ncombines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic\nassessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality\nanalysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based\nrepresentations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance\nmodeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for\npart-level perception.

To address these challenges, we\npropose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection\ngating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles\nfour complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a\nmodality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse\ninterpretive perspectives.
