      "title": "EffiReasonTrans: RL-Optimized Reasoning for Code Translation",
      "summary": "Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance.\nWhile recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved\nautomated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of\nincreased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that\ninvolve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose\nEffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy\nwhile balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality\nreasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model,\nDeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each\n(source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and\nfunctionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a\ntwo-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented\nsamples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and\nbalance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation\npairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation\naccuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while\nreducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference\nlatency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the\ncomplementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally,\nEffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into\nagent-based frameworks.

      "summary": "Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct\ngeneration of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive\nenumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder\nchemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and\ngenerate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the\ntargeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We\ndemonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with\ndielectric constant >3, bandgap >4 eV, and glass transition temperature >400 K,\nalongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000\ngenerated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and\nvalidated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance\nusability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it\nwith a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property\nprediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a\nversatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.",

      "summary": "Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe\nvalue functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is\nlimited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able\nto overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate\nconvergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of\nself-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that\nenriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the\nnature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and\nsolution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems\nand simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial\nDeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum\ndifferential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding\noptimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies\nfor worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional\nsimulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that\nour approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in\nsimulation and produces impressive results in hardware.",

      "title": "Search Self-play: Pushing the Frontier of Agent Capability without\n  Supervision",
      "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the\nmainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries\nto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer\npredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

      "summary": "Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition\nwhere actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture\nit. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We\nground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating\ndepender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence\ncoefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize\ncomplementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,\nmodeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We\nintegrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation\nand introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates\nstructural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental\ntesting across power and logarithmic value function specifications,\ndemonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the\nSamsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications\nachieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions\nprovide theoretical tractability.

      "summary": "Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent\ninformation retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.\nAlthough reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models\ncapable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by\nshallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative\ninteractions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search\nagent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection\nmechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection\npatterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and\nreinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world\nweb-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more\nreflective tool-use trajectories.

However, bridging the gap between\nstatic text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a\ncore challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale\nagentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing\nMid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning\n(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances\nreasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real\nsoftware engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions.

      "summary": "Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions\nbased on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In\nmany real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,\nagents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide\nadditional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are\ninherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP\nleads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented\nMDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot\naccommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect\npredictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a\nreal-world wind energy storage control problem.",

While\nrecent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,\nthey are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most\ninformative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a\ndialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy\nvia Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated\ndialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of\nbinary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space.

Our model generalizes\nclassical contextual pricing by accommodating richer agent action spaces. Over\n$T$ rounds with $d$-dimensional contexts, we establish an asymptotically tight\nexponential $T^{1 - \\Theta(1/d)}$ bound in terms of the pessimistic Stackelberg\nregret, benchmarked against the best utility for the principal that is\nconsistent with the observed feedback.\n  We also establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2d}})$ on\nthe classic Stackelberg regret for principal-agent games, demonstrating a\nsurprising double-exponential hardness separation from the contextual pricing\nproblem (a.k.a, the principal-agent game with two actions), which is known to\nadmit a near-optimal $O(d\\log\\log T)$ regret bound [Kleinberg and Leighton,\n2003, Leme and Schneider, 2018, Liu et al., 2021]. In particular, this\ndouble-exponential hardness separation occurs even in the special case with\nthree actions and two-dimensional context.

To investigate this paradox, we\nconstruct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes,\nand run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized.\nUsing Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose\ntwo unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations,\nand Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels. Results\nacross multiple model backends and orchestration frameworks reveal consistent\ntrends: higher trust improves task success but also heightens exposure risks,\nwith heterogeneous trust-to-risk mappings across systems. We further examine\ndefenses such as Sensitive Information Repartitioning and Guardian-Agent\nenablement, both of which reduce OER and attenuate AD.
