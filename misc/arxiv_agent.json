      "title": "Exploring Autonomous Agents: A Closer Look at Why They Fail When\n  Completing Tasks",
      "summary": "Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,\ncurrent evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically\nanalyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within\nthese systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative\nprogrammable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this\nbenchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with\ntwo LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.\nThrough in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure\ncauses aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution\nissues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose\nactionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis\ncapabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides\nan empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous\nagent systems in the future.",

      "title": "Bayesian Optimization-based Search for Agent Control in Automated Game\n  Testing",
      "summary": "This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents\ncontrolling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level.\nHarnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient\nsearch, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data\ncollected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information\nacquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific\nmodel built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty\nestimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the\nscalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate\nthat the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time\nefficiency and exploration distribution.",

      "title": "AutoBnB-RAG: Enhancing Multi-Agent Incident Response with\n  Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
      "summary": "Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed\ndecision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,\ntheir reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In\nthis work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that\nincorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident\nresponse simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game\nenvironment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and\nincorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation\nimproves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational\nmodels. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms\ninto LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.",

      "title": "Precise Action-to-Video Generation Through Visual Action Prompts",
      "summary": "We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for\naction-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining\ntransferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation\nfaces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive\nactions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while\nagent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain\ntransferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we\npropose to \"render\" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic\nrepresentations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain\nadaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for\ntheir generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct\nskeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions\n(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of\naction-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into\npretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable\nprecise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of\ncross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page:\nhttps://zju3dv.github.io/VAP/.",

      "title": "Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation:\n  A Survey",
      "summary": "Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires\nprecise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based\nmethods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In\nrecent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have\nemerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first\nsystematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic\nmanipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and\ndelineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,\nencompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of\nintegration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning\nfrom execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this\nfoundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:\n(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,\ntraining-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model\nintegration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating\narchitectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks\nthat support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,\nincluding memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent\ncooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent\nadvances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research\nfragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of\nstudies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide\na regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:\nhttps://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.",

      "title": "On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning",
      "summary": "Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a\nfundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A\nmotivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line\nsegment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one\nat a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any\narm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general\n$k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$\nstate-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under\nconstraints encoded as a set $\\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.\n  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we\nprovide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or\n$\\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants\nsupporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the\napplicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of\nscheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained\nenvironments.",

      "title": "WebMall -- A Multi-Shop Benchmark for Evaluating Web Agents",
      "summary": "LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,\nsuch as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and\nsubsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This\npaper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall\nconsists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers\nsourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These\ntasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,\nperforming price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing\ncheckout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague\nrequirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible\nproducts. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or\nShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple\nshops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they\noriginate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall\nrequire longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining\nrepresentative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline\nagents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and\nunderlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The\nbest-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1\nscores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.\nWebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to\npromote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce\nscenarios.",

      "title": "Analyzing Information Sharing and Coordination in Multi-Agent Planning",
      "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model\n(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,\nlong-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed\ninformation and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a\nchallenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a\ntravel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate\nthe impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an\norchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between\nagents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by\n18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce\nerrors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms\nachieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute\nimprovement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results\nhighlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective\norchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.",

      "summary": "Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is\nan ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells.\nAccordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven\nby them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a\nbiohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a\nlikelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from\ntheir discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal\nwith information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for\nheterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that\nthe heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.",

      "title": "Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via\n  Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards",
      "summary": "Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'\nemotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional\nwell-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on\npredefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life\nscenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,\nthis paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly\nlearns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement\nlearning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based\nmulti-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect\nfuture-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is\nsubsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we\nincorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further\nenhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's\nresponses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two\npublic ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and\nresponse quality.",
