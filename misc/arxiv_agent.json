      "title": "Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on\ntime-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed\nintervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and\ncommunication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG\n(Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a\nframework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its\nevent-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,\nET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to\nlearn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios\nwith inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based\nvariant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective\ncommunication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to\ntrigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to\nexchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with\nany policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both\ncomputational load and communication overhead.",

      "summary": "Disfluencies -- such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" interjections, parentheticals, and edited\nstatements -- remain a persistent challenge for speech-driven systems,\ndegrading accuracy in command interpretation, summarization, and conversational\nagents. We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled\ntext-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for\nthis task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating\ndisfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically\nevaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies,\nand architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently\nimproves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented\nmodels tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near\nstate-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We\nfurther present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical\nrecommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven\npipelines.

      "title": "On Robustness of Consensus over Pseudo-Undirected Path Graphs",
      "summary": "Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or\ndirected communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in\ninformation exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states,\nwhile directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root\nnodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on\nachievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network\ntopologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional\nconnectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to\ndiffer, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions.\nThe resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus\nunder connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the\nsystem to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull\nof the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights\nfor a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous\ninterception of a moving target.",

      "summary": "Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,\nunderscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen\nnovel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and\nhyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies\nfurther validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to\nuncover novel, biologically relevant associations.

      "title": "Energy Use of AI Inference: Efficiency Pathways and Test-Time Compute",
      "summary": "As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and\nagentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy\nuse are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and\nefficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how\ndata centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains\nduring the internet and cloud build-up.",

This study establishes a\ntheoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \\celeg\\ and\nreinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as\ndistributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing\nforaging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror\ncross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm.

This behavioural\nheterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing\nswarm-level extinction of outdated strategies.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical\napplications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex\nreal-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current\nprompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated\ninferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To\naddress this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)\nframework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent\npipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors\nhow physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and\naccurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a\nMACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician\nagents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and\nhuman oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390\nreal-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs\n(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves\nprimary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with\ngains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on\npar with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over\nphysicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it\nachieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,\nself-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,\nand model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable\nrationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a\nscalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap\nbetween the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.",

Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge\nto them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own\nconversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to\nthis failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental\nin the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a\nconversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I\nwill claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the\nestablishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a\nfundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of\nhallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the\ndisconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical\nconversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with\nseveral additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour.
